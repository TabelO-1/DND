Damien Cross is the Vice President of the Venus Conglomerate. 

He is an ancient wizard from the earliest days of civilization. He has wanted to hold power for thousands of years and did so during ancient eras of conquests and colonization. He spent each life in positions of priviledge or nobility that fueled his desires. However during the age of rebellion and change he lost everything.

He didn't give up on his machinations and influenced many terrible events and wars during industrial eras and is personally responsible for several of these events. As the civilization turned to the space age they found that their industrial way of living was destroying their world and wanted to start moving towards renewable energy sources.

His ancient mind saw an opportunity and quickly began getting industrial groups to lobby against these changes. After a long battle where the environmentalists and industrialists went back and forth while the planet detrioated faster and faster.

While the SpaceX went about their Mars Colonization Mission he sabatoged the Mars Jump Gate to ensure his rising company, at the time known as Morrowbane Enterprises, could maintain it's growing monopoly on space.

As civlization transferred into space he was known at the time as Lucian Morrowbane. Lucian Morrowbane changed the company to be known as the Venus Conglomerate when they setup their HQ on the Venus I Major Orbital Colony.

Now his grandson runs the company and his next reincarnation is Damien Cross. He controls Alexander to do his will. Damien wants to control everything, everyone. His ultimate goal is a conquest over all. Presently he is attempting to supress a web of factions to gain enough power. 

Right now his eyes are set on the Kuiper Belt, which has newly discovered riches that would grant him enough power to take down everyone else. To bolster his agenda he employs the Marauders, in which he uses to justify the company amassing a formidable "defensive" fleet.
