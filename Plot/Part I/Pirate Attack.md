Pirate Assault of VIOC.

# Section I Initial Suprise:
This is where the chaos would start, alarms suddenly ringing, the station shaking and boarding happening with disorganized security forces getting picked off everywhere. The players would hear reports of a pirate leader on the lower decks but not encounter or know who. The announcements from station security would be blaring constantly.

Narrative:

Klaxons blare loud sound and red swirling light around the station alarting residents to imminent danger. A Hologram for some establishments and Upper Levels starts speaking, for the lower sections all they hear is a voice:
    "This is Richard Anderson, Head of Corporate Security. This is not a drill, I repeat this is not a drill. The pirate group Marauders have just appeared on short-range sensors with a large battle group. They are presumed to be headed this way and are preparing to board the station.
    
    All Citizens should report to the desinated shelther zones or other sealed compartment. Station decompression is expected in several levels.
    All Security Personal report to your barracks immiedately. Volunteer groups or persons meet at the nearest security checkpoint. Stay Safe."

    Just minutes afterwards the station starts shaking from impacts and explosions reverberate throughout the corridors as pirate vessels engage station defenses and ships. Boarding actions start and chaos that was already happening explodes as raiders swarm areas of the station, killing, looting, and defeating disorganized and overwhelmed security forces.

 Convey urgency as everyone navigates the station, encountering all sorts of groups. A few skirmishes with pirates and security personal escorting or giving diring warnings to civilians.

 As the group travels they can here talk of a pirate leader leading the assault, but details are few. A security annoucement from Richard Anderson informs,

    "Security Forces are being overwhelmed, withdrawl towards the upper levels. Citizens are now obiligated to use any means of defending themselves."

 Foreboading should send the sense of the looming threat posed by this leader, who is coordinating and beating back security.
# Section II Pirate Push:
This section the pirates would be focusing on pushing throughout the station and achieving their prison breakout goals. The player character would be freed, and the security would be routing them out of the Upper levels and pushing downwards.

 Narrative:

 A third annoucement suddenly blares across the annoucers, this time a different voice,

    "This is Prison Command, Pirates are overrunnig prison security and releasing all the prisoners. We can't hold ou-" *The recording is suddenly shut off*. *Tyler now gets playing as Carl back.*
 
 This comes as the players recieve more information about security forces being pushed back to the upper levels entirely. For long moments it seems like the station may actually fall to them. There are many questions about where these numbers are coming from. Pirates are looting everywhere. At this point the factions and trapped security forces in the lower levels start meeting together to try and resist. The players will catch wind of this.

 When they hear of the prison break Slyva should ask if now is an opportune time to stage a rescue mission. If they do so they must navigate through hostile territory against pirates and security measures.

 The players may attempt to disrupt pirate actions by targeting systems, supplies or disabling communications. the players can also seek out alliances from different factions, including the Venus Conglomerate.

 In encounters pirates invoke guerrilla tactics, hit-and-runs, ambushes, traps to catch security forces and players off guard. The pirates will take hostages of civilians and station personal/security. The pirates will show their force with nonsense violence to instill fear. 
 
 During this time the station with take structural damage as pirate blast bulkheads and deploy explosives to breach fortified areas. This creates areas that require a space suit along with other hazardous environments and obstacles. Such as the main stairwell being out of use in certain sections.

 Special Encounter:

 They hear that Rebecca Stone, Head of HR has been captured by pirates and have a change to save her and gain favor with the VC.
 
# Section III Corporate Security Emerges:
This section would involve the final pushes to forcibly disembark the pirates from the station and recovery security of the area. At this phase the Earth Government would arrive as backup and deliver the final push for the Space Battle to route the pirates, but not before they ran off with loot, lives, and prisoners.
