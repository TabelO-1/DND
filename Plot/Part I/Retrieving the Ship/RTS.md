Impound Restrictions: The ship is held in a high-security dock in the Upper Station, guarded by the Venus Conglomerate's automated systems and patrolled by security personnel.

Lockdown Procedures: Due to the playersâ€™ wanted status, the impound area is flagged, meaning anyone attempting to retrieve the ship will be scrutinized. The ship is also locked behind multiple layers of security: access codes, clearance protocols, and physical security measures.

To retrieve their ship they need to access three systems in the impound dock:

Accessing the door system to open the dock, security clearance to get into the dock, and disabling tracking devices on the ship.



# Splitting the Party into tasks:

## Hacking the Impound System (likely bryson with his high eng score):
**Task**: Someone needs to hack into the system to either erase the ship's record, disable security alarms, or retrieve the ships access codes.

**Challenge**: This will require someone accessing a high security server room. This room will be guarded and require some clever thinking to access. Biometric scans to enter the room are needed.

For example posing as a maintenance tech may work. To do so they would need stolen uniforms and identification.

## Acquiring Clearance (or forging):
**Task**: The team will need a legitamite access pass to the ship's impoundyard. They need to bribe someone, forge a document, or steal the credentials from an offical.

**Challenge**: Stealing the credentials may require infiltating an event or upper-class area, which will take time to setup, gather information, and execute without blowing cover. This may take time to setup.

Forging Credentials will be difficult because they would have to find someone to forge credentials for them, this may require a substantial amount of money. In addition the bad reputation the characters have with criminal factions may hinder this objective.

Bribery: Bribing their way into the dock may work, however they would need to find someone that wouldn't immediately sell them out, and have enough money to bribe them.

## Disabling Security Measures:
**Task**: Disable physical security measures (Gates, Blast Doors, checkpoints, guards) without drawing a security response.

**Challenge**: This could involve stealing security codes or taking out a patrol quickly enough they don't have time to call for help.

May take time for security patrols to quiet down after a recent break-in or await a window of opportunity to steal access codes.

# Delay
Impound dock closure: The impound docks are currently closed due to a high amount of thefts from the impound docks from a few days ago. This was a pirate attack on the impound dock.

Encounters or roleplay during this delay:
Gangsters approach a character: The Vitral Gangsters are here to talk to the party about interfering with their operations.
Detection: The player(s) are detected by a security officer. This could lead to a pursuit.
Factions getting involved: The other factions mat offer aid in exchange for the party assisting them in interfering with the Conglomerates actions.
