# Part 0: Escape Marauder Station

 In the year 2150, the SpaceX Mars Colonization Project reached fruition. Many Colony ships were sent with people onboard them. According to history, Colony Ship SPX-C-021 had a jump gate miscalculation and instead rammed into the jump gate, destroying the gate and the ship.

 Now the players were colonists, and will wake up from their cryo-stasis cells to the intruder alarm. They will have time to realize they are drifting through space with just a small fraction of the ship. They will need to go around and fix ship systems to send a distress signal. The pirates will pick it up, if they are in the security room they will see them boarding. After a fight, they will be subdued. They will be prisioners. Gavin, another colonist taken with will be killed during that remainder. The station is build on the remnants of the ship. The pirates are descendants of colonists that woke up immediately after the crash. 

 The station will come under attack and will be disabled. Causing it to lose power and the characters' cell door to unlock. They will fight to the hanger and come toe to toe with the attacking force, who reveal themselves as AstroCorp. AstroCorp let's them come onto their shuttle and they make their escape.

 AstroCorp will ask some questions and run a DNA test(either voluntary or not). They will realize they were an early colonist, somehow, and since only the best were taken(or so history says). They will attempt to recruit them for a mission: Kuiper Belt Mining Rights.

 If **YES**: AstroCorp will be delighted, and give each player 1000 credits and drop them off at Venus I Orbital Colony because they cannot directly transport the party.

 If **NO**: AstroCorp will attempt to negiotiate with the party but if no is no, then they will simply drop you off at the Venus I Orbital Colony Prison.
