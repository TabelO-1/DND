The big bad evil guy is the assisant to the Venus Conglomerate's CEO, whom is his puppet. He has been in control of the Venus Conglomerate since it's inception. He is an ancient being or wizard that has been around since the rise of Rome. He reincarnates every time he dies. He has been an evil man in many of his lives. From being different roman emperors, genghis Khan, to hitler. It was his efforts that caused the earth to become a wasteland. The players on a misson on earth can find a recording of one of his past lives advocating against climate change policies, sucessfully. He did this to destabalize the government in an attempt to take over. This was unsucessful. He also destroyed the Mars Jump Gate so others wouldn't gain too much power in space. His eventual goal is to take over all life. To meet this goal he is supressing everyone and every faction as best he can, but knows at current he is not strong enough to take on the government. His salvation: The Kuiper Belt. With this belt he would control enough raw resources to easily defeat the government. The Marauders are on his payroll to make attacks on everyone to justify him owning a sizeable "Defensive" fleet.
