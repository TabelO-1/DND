The primary antagonist lurks within the ranks of the Venus Conglomerate, pulling strings as the shadowy vice president behind the puppet CEO. This figure, an ancient being or wizard with roots tracing back to the days of Rome, has held sway over the conglomerate since its inception. With each demise, he reincarnates, perpetuating a cycle of malevolence across the annals of history. From the corridors of Roman power to the conquests of Genghis Khan and the atrocities of Hitler, his presence has cast a dark shadow upon humanity.

Despite his nefarious machinations, it was his actions that led to the Earth's desolation, orchestrating events that plunged the planet into a wasteland. Even in past lives, traces of his cunning can be found, such as recorded instances where he successfully campaigned against climate change policies to destabilize governments. Yet, despite his efforts, some schemes faltered, such as his failed bid to overthrow established authorities by wrecking the Mars Jump Gate, preventing others from rising to power in space.

Driven by an insatiable hunger for dominion, his ultimate goal remains the conquest of all life. Presently, he navigates the intricate web of factions, suppressing dissent and manipulating events from the shadows. His eyes are set on the Kuiper Belt, a trove of resources that would grant him unparalleled power. To bolster his agenda, he employs the Marauders, orchestrating attacks to justify amassing a formidable "defensive" fleet. But even as his schemes unfold, he knows that challenging the government directly remains a daunting task.
