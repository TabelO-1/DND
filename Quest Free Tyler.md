# Quest: Free Tyler

To free tyler from his imprisonment the players will need 10000 nat 20s or actually follow a quest route:

Tyler's Charges:

Owning a firearm without a permit.
Unjustified use of lethal force
Attempting to Bribe an Officer
Bringing in illegal substances
Landing without authorization.
Flying a stolen shuttle.
Disturbing the Peace
Firing an firearm

After accepting the Hafling Guild, and hopefully suceeding, Lucan(Halfling Guild) will give them some information:

> He will inform them that he will contact his sources and asks them to come back later that day with some answers. He asks them to meet him at *The Prancing Demon* in the Upper Slums.
>
> When they arrive at *The Prancing Demon*. They will be intercepted by a prostitute when they enter, they are easy to get around. They'll find him and if prompted he will explain that they are no ears here.
>
> He will tell them what he has learned: *Tyler* was arrested, taken to *The Precinct*, a major Police center, where he was interrogated and tried for his crimes where he was convincted and has been sentenced to *142 years of jail time*.
>
> He was then moved to the Station Jail down on the very lowest spire, which is well guarded, and will be hard to break into.
>
> If prompted he can consider helping them further but he will need something else: *The Quiet Garden Orphanage* has been asking the Guild for assistance in dealing with the Vitral Gangsters.

The Orphanage will require the players to confront the Gangsters and likely give them a beatdown to convince them to stop.










To find out where tyler is they will need to get that information somehow. Other ways I will BS but these are the planned ways:

Help from the Halfing Guild:
The players can approach the halflings for help. They will sound reluctant to help you but they say if you can free one of their members from the Gangsters they will see what they can do.

After this mission they will be able to locate him: 
Prison. The Prison on the bottom of the Station.

Help from the Gangsters:
Using Bryson's connection to them they can request assistance from the Gangsters. If you steal from the Halflings they can use their contacts to find him.

After this mission they will be able to locate him: 
Prison. The Prison on the bottom of the Station.

Miners:
The Miners have alot of reason to hate the VC. With little convincing they will want to help you. They will get out fake id cards to get past the checkpoint.

Chruch: Unwilling
VC: Will arrest you if you try.
