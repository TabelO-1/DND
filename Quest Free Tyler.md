# Quest: Free Tyler

To free tyler from his imprisonment the players will need 10000 nat 20s or actually follow a quest route:

To find out where tyler is they will need to get that information somehow. Other ways I will BS but these are the planned ways:

Help from the Halfing Guild:
The players can approach the halflings for help. They will sound reluctant to help you but they say if you can free one of their members from the Gangsters they will see what they can do.

After this mission they will be able to locate him: 
Prison. The Prison on the bottom of the Station.

Help from the Gangsters:
Using Bryson's connection to them they can request assistance from the Gangsters. If you steal from the Halflings they can use their contacts to find him.

After this mission they will be able to locate him: 
Prison. The Prison on the bottom of the Station.

Miners:
The Miners have alot of reason to hate the VC. With little convincing they will want to help you. They will get out fake id cards to get past the checkpoint.

Chruch: Unwilling
VC: Will arrest you if you try.
