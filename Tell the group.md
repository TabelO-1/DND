Dax and Boroka:

The Headmistress will then offer to stay for the night. 

If they say yes: they will stay and have interactions with the children. In the morning she will tell them to find Lucan because she informed them she told Lucan of their acts.


The runners:

Brian runs and runs and finds a corner to hide in, the party loses him.
The rest of the runners find their way back to the docks where they encounter Jayli who again offers to lodge them for the night. They will awake in the dock.
