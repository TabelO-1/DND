Bedroom Scene(s):

Room 110(Bryson):
You walked away from the desk with your room key and navigated towards your room. As you walk in you take in the room, it is a small room hosting a twin bed that takes up most of the room with a small desk and fridge next to it. On the wall across from the bed is a small TV. To the left is a toilet that has seen better days along with a sink that has no soap. Sitting on the desk is a small computer that looks like it hasn't been used in years along with a TV remote.

[Computer]: The computer doesn't immediately turn on when you hit the power button, you can't immediately discern the problem. If manages to fix then he can surf the station web.
[TV]: Plays a terrible movie and the news channels cover the VC's successes with their current CEO Alexander Morrowbane and also discusses a savage attack on a Earth PZ.

Room 132:
As you walk into the room you immediately notice that this room has seen better days. The walls are scratched and dented, the bed has no coverings, and there is a broken TV on the floor. Next to the twin-sized bed is a small desk with a computer that looks actually well-maintained for the rooms condition. On your left is a toilet that smells god-awful and the sink is broken on the floor.

[TV]: The TV is unrepairable
[Computer]: Turns on just fine. Can surf the station web.

Room 191:
This room appears to be in rather good shape, likely a newer one. You notice a queen-sized matress in the middle with a desk and computer next to it. On the wall there is a reasonably sized TV and the room smells rather nice. A relatively clean toilet and sink are to your left. However the room is quite cold and there isn't a heater here.

[TV]: Talks about the pirate threat facing the VIOC station in recent years. It explains of the ramping up attacks.
[Computer]: Can be turned on and used to surf the station web.

Room 232
As you walk into the room you are you flick on the light and take the room in. You see a well-used twin-mattress and a computer on a desk and a toilet and sink to the right. As you see this however you notice movement from under the bed.

[Upon_Investigation]: As you search under the bed you find a little chocolate lab puppy who is growling at you. It seems scared.
[Computer]: Can be turned on and used to surf the station web.
