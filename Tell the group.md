# Jail Team
Sylva and Tristan are sitting in an alley in the refining district with the AK-47 and calls the cops on themselves.

The cops will show up led by Tralick Venel Desc: A Elf Male in his appearing to be in his 50s by human standards. Wearing a white robe with orange highligts he stands 6'3 tall with short grey hair.

They will be taken to the Precinct and Courtroom and found guilty unless they admit to it in which they will be taken straight to the Spire Prison.



# Ship Team
As you step out into the upper levels, you immediately hear a low noise, like a large engine running, in addition the area you are in is quite hot compared to where you just came from.

As you were told the checkpoint was below the dockyards, you need to go up, but there's an issue, the Guard Presence here is much higher.


The Impound dock is currently sealed off, no visitors in or out, due to a large number of thefts in a short time.




# Dax Chruch
Dax leaves for the Chruch?

Entering the Chruch:
A serene and ethereal sense washed over you as you look into the Chruch, unlike last time you were here when it was darker, the room is completely full of light. The room is a bright white and is light very well. 

As you look in, above you you see the pattern of the stars and the Milky Way. You look ahead and see many people seated whispering under their breath while watching a Priestess, the one you saw on the holo-call from earlier gripping a podium that swirls with blue patterns of stardust, almost like a nebula.

She is delivering a sermon to the crowd. She says, "The stars and deites that lie beyond our plane are guiding us. We follow them not at their demand, but because we seek their wisdom. Our answers will not always be found, but in our pursuit of the answers we seek, we discover ourselves in the journey."

As she finishes, the Priestess, looking out towards the congregation, turns to you, and smiles. The people gathered begin to disperse, some heading to a marble door to your left, others take looks at you before exiting the door behind you.

If the Priestess is approached, she will say, "Greetings Traveler. The Astral has led you to us, what questions weigh on your soul?"
