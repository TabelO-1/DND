When the orphanage either falls or stands the following happens.

# The Orphanage Stands

The Staff will be very grateful and offer lodging any time the party needs it. Most of the children go on oblvious but a few of the older orphans know what the party did.

Leshanna Liadon the Headmistress, a older appearing female elf with brown hair that wears a grey dress and holds a cracked smile in her face, will be very thankful. She offers a favor to help the party and is willing to answer any questions to the best of her ability.


After beating down the gangsters they have learned to not attack the orphanage but the party has drawn the attention of the gangster leader, Brutus Kane. A lieutenant will stop them as they attempt to leave the floor and tell them that Brutus Kane has a message for them and place a holo-communicator down on the ground(something quite expensive) and he will look at them and inform them that countinued meddling in their affairs will have consequences.

When they go to speak with Lucian once more they shall instead find Liliana, leader of the halflings, and speak to them on the matter. She will get in touch with the AstroCorp operatives and inform the party to meet them at dock 12-C.
