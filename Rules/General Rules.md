Turn rules:
5 *possible* Actions per round that you may take in any turn.
 - **Action:** *An action to complete during a turn.* **Examples:**
      - Attack: *Make one melee or ranged attack.*
      - Cast a Spell: *Use a learned spell or prepared cantrip.*
      - Dash: *Double your current movement speed for this turn.*
      - Disengage: *Move away from enemies without provoking opportunity attacks.*
      - Dodge: *Focus on avoiding attacks, until your next turn attack rolls on you have disadvantage if you can see the attacker. Dexerity saving throws have advantage.*
      - Help: *Lend your aid to another creature. That creature gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with.*
      <Br> *Alternatively you may aid a friendly creature in making a attack if that defender is within 5 feet of you. You distract the defender and your ally gains advantage on the* **first** *attack roll.*
       - Ready: *Using the ready action allows you to use your reaction before your next turn. First you decide what may trigger your reaction and the response you will take.*
       <br> *If the trigger occurs you may take your reaction immediately or after the trigger, or you can chose to ignore the trigger.*
       <br> *You can ready a spell by "holding in its energy". When you do this you cast the spell as normal and must concentrate on holding it in. If your concentration is broken then your spell has no effect.*
       - Search: *You look for something. Depending on the nature of your search you may need to make a perception or investigation check.*
       - Use an Object: *Normally object interactions happen on your interact, however if the object requires an action to use you take this action type. This can be helpful if you want to interact with multiple objects in one turn.*
 - **Movement:** *Moving around to any point that you can reasonably reach in the turn length.*
 - **Interact:** *Interact with someone or something in your environment.*
 - **Reaction:** *If conditions are correct, you may take a reaction outside of your turn.*
 - **Bonus:** *Take any of the the other three actions or a pre-defined bonus action on your character sheet with the exception of making a second attack unless it is a feature of your character.*
