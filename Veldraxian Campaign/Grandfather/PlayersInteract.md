**Session 1:**
Meeting the Grandfather (Again)

Note: the other two didn't have the greatest chance to interact, as Tolin and Shadow bickered back and forth a lot. 

Aeris: Maintained his distance, was generally quiet and less familial with everyone, as he met them for the first time. 
Quenlith: Also didn't talk much, but her interactions was that of loyalty with to Grandfather. Was also very conscious of his elderly state
Shadow: Was very friendly with the Grandfather, on more than one occasion, giving him a hug. Was very interested in listening to him 
Tolin: The interrupter and immature one. She interrupted the Grandfather with rude comments, always one to speak her mind. She clearly is attached to the Grandfather, in her own way (being rude) she displayed general rebellion against him, but also conformed, and yet was very clear on not allowing him to strain his old body. 
**Session 2:**
Shadow's Return

Interactions with the Old Man were short, kept to pre-existing information. Terrible breakfast, a thoughtful goodbye with words of wisdom, and Shadow loving huggies.
