### NPC Summary: The Grandfather

The man you know as the Grandfather, in truth is a half-elf who has already lived the adventuerer's life. He is now old, having spent decades of his life adventuring, traveling, battling, and studying. In his youth he was an adventurer of some renown, he spent time everywhere throughout the Kingdom, from the capital to the port cities, from the farmlands to the mines. Wherever there was trouble, mystery, or need, he was willing to take it on, but not out of greed or desire for fame, but because helping others is what he did.

During those years, travelling with his adventuring party, he built his reputation as a reliable wizard. He accepted odd jobs just as readily as grand quests, solving troubles of commonman and the nobleman alike. Through this, he met many connections. Merchants trusted him, nobles respected him, and scholars would listen when he spoke. He retired 13 years past, ending his adventuring career, settling in Greenrest.

Time has since passed, where he was once known, his name fades away, only remembered by those who were influenced by him in some way. His retirement did not mean he became idle, instead he turned inward, devoting himself to his craft, his studies, and watching the world for afar.
