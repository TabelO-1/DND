### NPC Summary: The Grandfather - Player Edition

The man you know as the Grandfather, in truth is a half-elf who has already lived the adventuerer's life. He is now old, having spent decades of his life adventuring, traveling, battling, and studying. In his youth he was an adventurer of some renown, he spent time everywhere throughout the Kingdom, from the capital to the port cities, from the farmlands to the mines. Wherever there was trouble, mystery, or need, he was willing to take it on, but not out of greed or desire for fame, but because helping others is what he did.

During those years, travelling with his adventuring party, he built his reputation as a reliable wizard. He accepted odd jobs just as readily as grand quests, solving troubles of commonman and the nobleman alike. Through this, he met many connections. Merchants trusted him, nobles respected him, and scholars would listen when he spoke. He retired 13 years past, ending his adventuring career, settling in Greenrest.

Time has since passed, where he was once known, his name fades away, only remembered by those who were influenced by him in some way. His retirement did not mean he became idle, instead he turned inward, devoting himself to his craft, his studies, and watching the world for afar.

### NPC Summary: Grandfather DM Edition

The man you know as the Grandfather is, in truth, a half-elf who has already lived a full adventurer’s life. Now old, he has spent decades traveling the breadth of the Kingdom of Veldraxi and beyond, battling threats both mundane and arcane, studying ancient magic, and placing himself wherever trouble, mystery, or quiet suffering demanded attention. He never sought fame or titles. Helping others was simply what he believed an adventurer was meant to do.

In his youth, he traveled with a capable adventuring party and earned a reputation as a reliable wizard and problem-solver. He took on humble requests as readily as grand quests, mending local crises for common folk while also being trusted by nobles, merchants, and scholars alike. Over time, he built an extensive web of connections and earned quiet respect across social and political boundaries. When he spoke, people listened, not because he demanded authority, but because his record justified it.

During those years, his party repeatedly encountered strange disturbances scattered across the land. Monsters appearing where none should, regions growing unstable, ancient ruins reacting violently to magic. These were often tied to forgotten sites of immense age, remnants of a civilization long vanished. Believing these phenomena to be signs of failing containment or decaying wards, the Grandfather did what he had always done: he fixed the problem in front of him.

On at least two occasions, he and his companions reinforced ancient seals buried beneath the Highreach Mountains and within the Greenwood Forest. The results were immediate and reassuring. Mines stabilized. Landslides slowed. The Greenwood’s changes became more gradual, less volatile. To all appearances, disaster had been averted. The Grandfather believed these successes marked the end of a slow, ancient collapse, and for many years, the world seemed to confirm him right.

What he did not know — what no living scholar truly understood — was that these seals were never meant to be permanent. They were part of a vast, ancient containment system designed to fail slowly and deliberately, bleeding pressure from an extraplanar breach into places that could endure it. By repairing and reinforcing seals already meant to be dying, the Grandfather did not stop the threat. He delayed it, compressed it, and forced it to adapt.

Unwittingly, he accelerated the final stage of the breach.

Thirteen years ago, believing the great dangers of his life resolved, he retired from adventuring and settled in the quiet village of Greenrest. Though his name slowly faded from public memory, his retirement was not a withdrawal from the world. He turned inward, devoting himself to study, observation, and reflection. He watched the Kingdom grow more rigid, its grip tightening. He noted strange patterns he could not fully explain. And, over time, he began to sense that something ancient was stirring again.

At the time of his call to the party, the Grandfather believes there were only seven seals, and that most of them are either ancient history or safely contained. He believes the earliest failures — in the Sunscorched Desert and the distant seas — are long past and irrelevant. He believes the dangerous forests are stable, if inaccessible. He believes Stonebridge still holds. From his perspective, his past interventions worked.

In truth, the system is reaching its final threshold.

The ancient breach remains incomplete, held back by a final, hidden seal deep within the Standing Stone Mesas. That seal was never meant to be known, repaired, or strengthened. It was meant to choose. And when the time comes, it will recognize the Grandfather — not as a hero, not as a villain, but as the living continuation of a system that has already given everything it had.

The tragedy of the Grandfather is not that he failed to save the world.

It is that he succeeded for too long.
