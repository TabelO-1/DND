### NPC Summary: The Grandfather

The man you know as the Grandfather, in truth is a half-elf who has already lived the adventurer's life. He is now old, having spent decades of his life adventuring, traveling, battling, and studying. In his youth he was an adventurer of some renown, he spent time everywhere throughout the Kingdom, from the capital to the port cities, from the farmlands to the mines. Wherever there was trouble, mystery, or need, he was willing to take it on, but not out of greed or desire for fame, but because helping others is what he did.

During those years, travelling with his adventuring party, he built his reputation as a reliable wizard. He accepted odd jobs just as readily as grand quests, solving troubles of the common man and the nobleman alike. Through this, he met many connections. Merchants trusted him, nobles respected him, and scholars would listen when he spoke. He retired 13 years past, ending his adventuring career, settling in Greenrest.

Time has since passed, where he was once known, his name fades away, only remembered by those who were influenced by him in some way. His retirement did not mean he became idle, instead he turned inward, devoting himself to his craft, his studies, and watching the world for afar.

### General World Information:

You all live in the Kingdom of Veldraxi, a relatively young realm of rolling grasslands, broad rivers, and long established roads. Two great forests fall within its borders, the ancient Elderward in the centerlands, and the Greenwood Forest farther south. King Veldane the Fifth rules from the great city of Veldspire in the far north, though for most common folk the kingdom is experienced not through the crown, but through local lords.

Two major rivers shape life across the kingdom. The Valenreach runs through the center of the realm, while farther north flows the Veldrun, which now carries a majority of the trade in the kingdom. Barges carry grain from the Harth Region south of the capital, supplying much of the kingdom’s food. These two rivers meet at the city of Rivergate, where they combine into a single great waterway that continues north toward Veldspire. Rivergate is the most populous city in the kingdom and where a great deal of its wealth is concentrated. Not far upriver lies Highriver, the second most populous city, serving as another major center of trade and commerce.

Following the rivers westward toward the sea, numerous trading towns dot their banks. Along the Veldrun, the most notable is Veldrun City. Along the Valenreach, Stonebridge sits near the  center of the kingdom and serves as a major crossing and trade hub. From there, the rivers continue on to the great port cities of Port Valen on the Valenreach and Grayhaven on the Veldrun, where trade meets the waters of the Veylmar Sea.

Southeast of the rivers lies the Highreach Region, a land of hills and broken mountains. A narrow route between Highreach and the Greenwood Forest crosses the Serevan River and leads into a quieter part of the kingdom known as Greenwood Verge. Following this road south eventually brings one to the small village of Greenrest, home of the Grandfather.

South of Stonebridge, and west of the Greenwood Forest, lies the Elven Kingdom. Its capital is the city of Lethariel, and its influence extends westward to Eldermere and south into the mist-shrouded Southshore Veil. While relations between the Elven Kingdom and Veldraxi are generally peaceful, the elves govern their lands by their own customs and laws.

The kingdom itself is predominantly human. Other peoples live within its borders, but human law and tradition prevail. Elves largely remain within their own realm. Dwarves are most commonly found in Highreach and in Stonehold, working mines and stone. Halflings are a familiar sight in the farming communities of the Harth Region.

The Adventurer’s Guild holds modest but notable influence throughout the kingdom, maintaining guild halls in every major city. Through these halls, adventurers are guided toward work that serves the needs of the realm, whether that be escort, exploration, or dealing with threats beyond the reach of ordinary folk.

There are places everyone knows to avoid unless desperation leaves no other choice. The Warding Weald is avoided entirely, known to turn travelers around or them never being seen again. The Southshore Veil is perpetually misted and wrapped in rumor, widely believed to be haunted. Far to the southeast lies the Sunscorched Desert, considered nearly impassable by most humans and home to a single enduring city where no one species dominates. To the far north are frozen lands where cold and dragons alike are said to claim the unprepared.

Human's reign over the region has been relatively recent. They only came to these shores around a thousand years ago, Lord Valen having landed where Port Valen now stands, the river Valenreach being named after him.

### Greenwood Verge

West of the Greenwood Forest and south of the High Reach Region is Greenwood Verge. Sparsely forested. The Serevan flows through the northern part of the region, with one path of the river going north, known as the Upper Serevan River, with the true path of the river flowing into the Sunscorched Desert. The region is generally uninteresting, and quiet.

The is one major town in the region, **Greenwatch Crossing**. It is a town of a few hundred people near the Serevan River Bridge. The road leading into the town leads two ways, first further south, ending at Greenrest, the other branch moving east along the river into the Desert.

**Greenrest**:

Greenrest is a small village almost as far south as the road goes. The town farms and cuts timber year round for trade. The town is most well known for the Cherry Blossom in the town's square, having been planted there when the first generation made a claim on the land. Despite being a small town, the town has a tavern, known as *Stefan's Tavern*, which serves the worst alcohol you've ever had, but Stefan insists you'll grow to like it. Though known to few, a once renowned wizard (The Grandfather) lives in the town, his home part house, part wizard tower.
