Greenrest is a small village almost as far south as the road goes. The town farms and cuts timber year round for trade. The town is most well known for the Cherry Blossom in the town's square, having been planted there when the first generation made a claim on the land. Despite being a small town, the town has a tavern, known as *Stefan's Tavern*, which serves the worst alcohol you've ever had, but Stefan insists you'll grow to like it. Though known to few, a once renowned wizard (The Grandfather) lives in the town, his home part house, part wizard tower.
