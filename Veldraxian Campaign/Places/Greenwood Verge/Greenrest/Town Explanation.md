Greenrest is the kind of place most people pass without noticing.

The road narrows as it reaches the village, the packed dirt worn smooth by years of carts rather than constant traffic. Fields stretch outward on all sides, broken only by low stone fences and the occasional stand of trees. Timber piles sit neatly stacked near homes, ready for trade or winter repairs. There is no wall, no gate, no guards posted with spears—only a quiet confidence that nothing much ever happens here.

At the center of the village stands a single cherry tree, its pale blossoms drifting lazily in the breeze no matter the season. A simple stone ring surrounds it, smoothed by generations of hands and resting travelers. Locals pass beneath it daily without comment, but there is something undeniably old about it, older than the village itself.

Greenrest survives by being forgettable. That is its greatest defense.

Most villagers know one another by name. Outsiders are noticed, but not feared. News travels slowly here, by conversation rather than proclamation. If danger were coming, it would arrive as a rumor long before it arrived as a threat.

And yet, for all its quiet, Greenrest is home to something that does not belong in a place like this.
