# Regions

## Capital Region
Home to the capital of the Kingdom, Veldspire. A small region, with the Northern Mountains to the north, Harth region across the Veldspire River to the south, and the Heartlands to its east. The King rules here, and Veldspire is a great city known for its towering spires all across the city. The capital is many things, populous, a military hub, a trade hub, a knowledge hub. It is said that the only city able to rival Veldspire would be the Elven capital of Lethariel, but even it is smaller than Veldspire.

## Northern Mountains
The mountains north of the Heartlands and Capital. These mountains are dense stone mountains that eventually transitions into ice mountains. The paths through the mountains are narrow and eventually end before you make it through the mountains, leaving the region mostly intraversible and most would agree there is no point in traversing them either.

## Heartlands Region
The heartlands region is where most the economic activity of the Kingdom is processed and collected. Trade ships coming from the Veldrun River pass through Highriver, a great city with a large human population, the river continues where it meets the Valenreach River, where even more trade ships converge on the city of Rivergate where the two rivers meet. It is the economic heart of the Kingdom and also a security checkpoint, stopping any invasion or nogood doers from moving past into the capital region. A majority of the food grown in the Harth region is also taken to Rivergate and moved down both rivers to sell south and west. After Rivergate is the Capital region, and the two rivers combine in the city and come out as the Veldspire Run

## Harth Region
The lowfields south of the capital. A broad region full of farmland and small yet significant farming villages, windmills, and the occasional hill. They supply most of the Kingdom with the food they eat.

The most significant city is Brakenford, a larger than usual farming town that also serves as the region's adminstrative center. These farming towns are also home to a number of halfings, some towns being entirely halfling.

## Veldrun River Region
Named after the River following through its region. It begins right after the Veldrun Splits near the Stonehold Mountains, the main path is the Veldrun River following all the way to the capital. The river splits again shortly after it splits into the Veilwater, this time the new path heading north to the Crownfrost Region, the new river named the Crownfrost River. Not far after that split is Veldrun city, the major city in the region. The City is a trade city, situatating itself on the rivers to provide a resting spot for barges coming to trade along the river or move on to the capital or out to the Sea. The region itself home to a number of trade cities and a road moving east towards the heartlands region, with Veldrun City as the most western point. The terrain is mostly grassy, but home to a number of hills and the northern part north of the Veldrun and Crownfrost rivers is mostly inhabited space.

## Central Grasslands
Between the Veldrun River and Veilwater river to the North and the Valenreach River in the south this region lies mostly empty. To the West is the Stonebridge region, and Lakehold is right on the otherside of the edge of the border of the region. The region is home to rolling grasslands, with a road leading from Lakehold to Rivergate, where the Veldrun and Valenrivers meet and combine. There are only a handful of villages in the region, leading to the most become a unimportant region, only noted by the Kingdom as making it hard to control its holdings to the East as they have to move resources through an empty region, making projecting influence down this route more difficult.

## The Warding Weald
A forest region upon the southern bank of the Valenreach River as it swells into Lake Elarion. Northwest of Highreach, East of Stonebridge, and south of the Central Grasslands. The Warding Weald is named such for its Warding Properties. The forest is covered in a permenant fog, and any traveler entering the forest will find themselves lost, turned around and out of the forest quickly, or never seen again. Many rumors floating about the place, but the consensus is that entering the forest is not worth the trouble.

## Highreach
Highreach is an outlier for most of the Kingdom, as it is full of rough terrain, hills and a number of mountains. The region is south of the Harth region, its most northern part just touching the Valenreach River, to its Northwest lies the Warding Weald. To the south is both the Greenwood Verge and Sunscorched Desert. Its most western post shares a border with the Stonebridge Region. The soil here is unfit for growing crops, as such a number of mining towns have sprouted up, and a number of dwarves inhabit the region alongside the humans. The Upper Serevan River runs through the region, the roads following it, a few villages along it. A little past the fork in the road leading north into Harth is a city build into the side of a mountain, Crownspire, named after the large spire that overlooks the hilly valleys of the region, one can see for miles atop it. The city is a bastion of military power, expected to hold any invading force if it were to try and breach Harth.

Along the border with the Harth Region, where the hills begin to thin out, a path leads you west. It leads you to the only Major Orcish Village in the Kingdom. Travellers known to avoid this way, and the royal army patrols to prevent orc attacks from hitting regional villages. Despite the Royal Army able to crush the orcs, whenever they send a force to destroy the village, the Orcs somehow always know, and pack up everything important and flee into the hills where they have not ever been caught.

Along the border with the Greenwooud Verge Region, just north of where the Serevan splits, and off of the road, lies a Tabaxi village, hidden to travelers but close enough for the Tabaxi to reach the road.

## Stonebridge
Situated south of the **Elderward**, the stonebridge region is named after the City of Stonebridge. The region follows the Valenreach river, with a few villages along the trading path and is made up mostly of grassland. To the south of the region, across the river leads the roads that take you to Greenwood Verge and Eldermere. This area is sparsely populated and home mix of grasslands, bushes, and the occasional grouping of trees. On its most Eastern part, lies the city of Lakehold, which rests on Lake Elarion. Across which is the Warding Weald. The Region is generally prosperous, known for its vineyards and orchards, along with the ancient stone crossing the Stonebridge propped up around.

## The Elderward
The Elderward Forest is an ancient forest, with tall pine trees and hilly terrain. The forest grows incredibly dense toward the center, and it is rumored to once have been home to an ancient race of elves. The Forest is situated centrally, north of Stonebridge and has the Valen's Landing and Northern Expanse regions to its west, with the Veldrun River Region to the North, with the central grasslands/stonebridge region to the east. The Veilwater River, which splits off earlier in the Stonehold Mountains runs through the Elderward, before rejoining the Veldrun Region outside of the forest.

## Greenwood Forest
A Forest region between the South Shore Veil and Greenwood Verge. South of Stonebridge and East of Eldermere (Lethariel). When the Eldermere River enters into the forest it becomes known as the Serevan River. The outside of the forest is sparse, but the trees grow denser and older as you push further in. South of the Serevan River closer to the Southshore Veil side is a Forest Elf/Druid City. It is a secret city to most, but is technically under the Elven Kingdom. It is named Iltheria.

## Greenwood Verge
Greenwood Verge is a quaint area, its namesake after its border with the Greenwood Forest. Here is a semi-sparse forested area, but sparse enough to not be considered an extension of the Greenwood Forest. The Serevan River flows through the northern part of the region, with it splitting, one path going north, with the Upper Serevan River heading into the Highreach Region, and the lower path flowing along the northern edge into the Sunscorched Desert.

Here there is one major village. Greenwatch Crossing, named after its proximity to the Serevan River Bridge. To the south of Greenwatch Crossing is two paths, one leads south, ending at a small village named Greenrest, the Grandfather's home. The second path leads east into the Sunscorched Desert.

## Sunscorched Desert
A scorching desert region with sanddunes shifting every hour. It is south of Highreach and East of Greenwood Verge. No one comes here of their own choice, most are fleeing some kind of trouble before they come here. the Serevan River flows through the region, providing it with its only major water source. Along the river is a Desert town named Ashkar's Respite, the only longlasting town in the desert. To the far south is rumored to have ancient ruins.

The Region is home to a number of species and races that typically have trouble fitting into human society. Tieflings, Genasi, and other lineages that are rarer and sometimes forced to flee human villages are welcome in Ashkar's Respite.

## Crownfrost
North of the Veldrun Region and home to Tundra and Arctic Landscape. The Crownfrost river moves into the region, splitting off from the Veldrun River, the river feeds into the Crownfrost Lake, and on its banks is a City named Frostwatch. It is an ancient city made of magicial ice and has since been repopulated by humanoid species, it was once an ancient repository of knowledge, now it is the only significant library city in the world, rumored to the host of any knowledge a mortal could seek, including magic. A single path breaks off in the Veldrun Region into the Crownfrost Tundra. The path is dangerous, cold, and deadly. Unprepared Victims attempting to make it there rarely do, as the cold isn't the only thing in the Tundra that can kill them. It is rumored that a number of adult dragons make the region home, adding another threat to travelling there.

## Barren Northern Lands
A barren region, half home to the artic region, with transitions into Tundra, Pine Forest, and then hilly grasslands. The region is renowned for its emptiness, as almost no one lives there. There is only one village of more than 30 people, and it sits just north of the Northern Expanse, and some consider it not to be a part of the Barren North.

## Northern Expanse
One of the most northern regions of the kingdom, north of Valen's Landing and south of the Barren Northern Lands. The region follows the Veldrun River until it passes the mountains that the dwarven city of Stonehold lies under. The major human city of the region is Grayhaven, a port city right on the mouth of the river as it moves out to sea. The region is mostly flat, grasslands with a few oak forests to the south.

## Valen's Landing
The region where Lord Valen landed when humans came to what would become the Kingdom of Veldraxi. the Valenreach River forming the south border between Valen's Landing and the Eldermere Region. The coastal region and Valenreach river are mostly lowlands, which are prone to flood year round, but north more inland is sparely populated forests, grasslands like much of this area of the continent, and a few small farming villages. At the mouth of the River lies Port Valen, the largest port city on the Veylmar Sea. To the northwest of Port Valen is a small city named Oceanwatch on the most western tip of the region. The city watches the waters for any sign of invasion coming across the sea but is primarily a large fishing village.

## Eldermere
Eldermere is split into two major regions. First is the Eldermere Coast. The City of Eldermere is there, sitting on Eldermere bay and the Eldermere River heading east. The region is split evenly between humans and elves, about 50/50. Eldermere however is formally part of the Elven Kingdom based in Lethariel, and not subject to Royal Law, though the Kingdom stil retains a permenant presence there. The Coastal Region itself is mostly lowlands and grasslands that are sparesly populated.

Between the two regions is the Murkmere Bog, a swampland known for its danger to adventurers, deadly creatures live there, and if one enters unprepared, one may not ever exit. The Bog is not well mapped out but it is known for its swampy waters, muddy terrain, and bogs that drag you into the ground and suffocate you.

To the east is the Lethariel Subregion. The elven capital is here, a almost 90% elven city home to the Elven Queen. From here she rules the Eldermere and Southshore Veil Regions, however the elvish hold is loose, and oftentimes subject to monarchic oversight from the largely human kingdom of Veldraxi. The region is east of the Murkmere Bog, and primarily composed of the Standing Stone Mesas. Tall circular mountains jut up from the ground, forming an impassible region. Just North of Lethariel is an arch known as the Northern Gate, as it leads into the Mesa Region, and it is the only entrance to the valley inside where there lay ancient ruins, whose former inhabitants are unknown.

## Southshore Veil
The Southshore Veil is a permenantly misty region. A low fog holds across the region. It is south of the Eldermere River, West of the Greenwood Forest, and East of the Veylmar Sea. The region is home to a giant forest of willow trees and home to a few small settlements. The region is known as a cursed region, where people disapear without explanation. Further inland is a mushroom forest that surrounds ancient mountains that know have scaled for centuries. The villages are sparse here and the roads inconsistent, often poorly marked or rerouted, making the region frustrating to travel to the unfamaliar.

## Veylmar Sea

The Sea seperating the Veldraxian Area from other parts of the world. It runs along the Northern Expanse, Valen's Landing, Eldermere Coast, and Southshore. The sea is turbulent, though most sailing on it have grown used to it, and few ships are lost nowadays. Foreign ships can travel the Sea to land in Grayhaven, Port Valen, or Eldermere for trade or travel. Humans come from west and south of the coastline of the Sea, having migrated north many centuries ago.

Scattered across the central portion of the Sea are the Saltward Isles. They rise evenly from the water, some tiny, others large enough to host civilization. The largest is a Neutral Hub, the Island used as a neutal meeting ground for nations that live dominate the different coastlines of the sea.
