# Kingdom of Veldraxi Campaign

The Kingdom of Veldraxi is a quiet, modest realm of rolling fields, winding forests, and scattered hills. Life here is simple, the dangers small and few enough that an adventurer can make a living helping townsfolk, hunting monsters, or taking on odd jobs. The king rules in the capital but for most, matters of the crown are far from your mind.

What matters to you is the man everyone calls the **Grandfather**.

Years ago, when you were struggling to find your place in the world, he took you in. He saw your potential long before you did. He paid for your training or gave it himself, he supported your ambitions, and gave you both guidance and a home. Whether you learned the ways of spellcasting, the discipline of the guard, the teachings of the church, or another path entirely, you would not be who you are without him.

Since then, time has carried you away into your own journeys. Now you stand at second level, experienced enough to be capable, yet still early in your adventuring life.

And then the letter arrived.

Written in his familiar hand, sealed with his simple crest. A message short and urgent, asking you to return to his home at once. He speaks of a matter too important to write down, something he insists must be discussed in person, something he fears cannot wait any longer.

For the first time since he guided your early steps, the Grandfather needs you. What awaits in your former home is unclear, but the call is unmistakable. Whatever lies ahead, it will shape not just your future, but the future of the entire Kingdom.
