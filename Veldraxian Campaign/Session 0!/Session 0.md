## Openning - 

This is a collaborative session. Nothing is locked in yet.

Our goal is to build the campaign together, align expectations, and to make sure every is comfortable and ready to begin playing. Adjustments are welcome.

## Rules, Preferences, Guardrails -

This is meant to be fun, respectful, and cooperative. Everyone here is responsible for maintaing that atmosphere, not just me. 

The general rating for things going on this game will be PG-13. Now I wanted to give everyone here a chance to name anything they don't want to see (Hard Limits) in the campaign. If you'd prefer to tell me privately that's fine too.
If we have any issues with any hard limit being crossed we'll pause the game and address that then and there. Again, we're here to have fun.

## Party Identity

What kind of party do you want? Neutral, Good, Evil, Mixed?

Backstory - Everyone is allowed to have the backstory they want, but ideally we'd like our characters to know eachother. You all know the Grandfather and owe some part of who you are today to him, but did you meet during that time? Perhaps you went on missions together for some time? Etc. Etc.

Ideally our characters aren't created in isolation, but with the party in mind. Do you all want to plan to have certain roles? Healer? Tank? Fighter? Etc.

As for creating characters, multi-classing is allowed as long as you meet the requirements. 2nd Level Characters. 

Player knowledge and Character knowledge are two seperate things, so try to keep that in mind. I don't have any issues with you using knowledge like "Hey I know this has a resistance to fire so I use a different spell".

## Play Style

When it comes to DND, what interests you most:
Combat, Exploration, Roleplay, Lorebuilding, Puzzles, or something inbetween. Is there sections you'd like highlighted and others lessened?

As for Roleplay specifically, do you prefer in-character dialogue or more of a descriptive narrative. How serious, dramatic, or comedic should the overall tone be?

As for narrative control, did you all want it to be more "players shape the world" or "Players in my world". At what point should I step in and suggest returning to the current task?

How do you all want to handle PVP? Is it allowed at all? Or with consent from both sides?

How would you like me to handle death and how deadly should the campaign be overall? Are you expecting every character to make it all the way to the end?

## Logistics

Scheduling!

Unless we objections, I'm thinking 5-8 or 6-9 PM Mondays. But we could do shorter or longer, but 9pm is the latest ending time. Weekly? Biweekly? Monthly? ETC. When should we have a break?

How long should I plan this campaign to run? 6 months? a Year? How long can forsee being able to commit to a campaign?

As for hosting sessions, I'd prefer to have a physical meeting location. (TJ is fine with being a laptop). Are people fine with that? If so, ideas for when/where (Pappys, My Home, someone elses' home, etc.)

If physical: What are expectations about cellphones at the table? Food/Drink should be generally okay (unless ya'll object)

When someone can't attend, what should we do? Should we reschedule or postpone? When should we play without someone? How should I handle someone's character if we play without them?

When will I cancel a session and why.
Work - I get called into work.
2 or more people don't show.
Pre-determined event (with notice!)
Emergency - Its an emergency

## Campaign talk!

The Campaign is still in early planning and your preferences can greatly influence it. Stances on Magic Accessibility, technology level, adventuring environments, major threats, themes, and whether they'd prefer a more linear story or more episodic?

I'd love to include as many player creations as possible, such as factions, locations, or personal goals. I'm open to adjust the premise based on what the group is most interested in. Even the basic campaign premise I'm fine to change.

Okay so yeah I want everyone to have fun with this. Now I'll open the floor for any general questions.

END END: Remind all that they can reach out to me about any limits they have about thing they don't want to see or any other general questions.
