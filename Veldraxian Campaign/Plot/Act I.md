Act I — The Quiet Years Ending

Act I Purpose

Act I exists to establish trust, normalcy, and pattern recognition. The party is not saving the world yet. They are solving problems that feel local, reasonable, and even mundane. The goal is for the players to believe they are in a grounded campaign about a strained kingdom, strange wilderness, and an aging mentor who needs help tying up loose ends.

Under the surface, Act I is when the seal system finishes transitioning from “managed decay” into “compressed failure.” The party does not cause the collapse, but their successes help hide it.

Opening State of the World

When the campaign begins, the Kingdom of Veldraxi is tense but functional. Trade continues. Guild work is plentiful. Monsters exist, but not in apocalyptic numbers. People are uneasy, not panicked. This matters. If the world already feels doomed, the later revelations lose impact.

The Grandfather knows something is wrong, but he does not yet know what. His letter is not prophetic or desperate. It is cautious, urgent, and restrained. He believes the system he once helped stabilize is destabilizing again, and he knows he is no longer capable of handling it alone.

Importantly, he does not believe the world is ending. He believes it is slipping.

Session 1 — The Call and the Return

The first session should be almost entirely personal.

The party reunites in Greenrest. They see the Grandfather’s home again, older, quieter, slightly overgrown. He is relieved to see them, not dramatic. He asks questions about their lives. He apologizes, gently, for calling them back.

When he explains why he summoned them, he speaks in incomplete thoughts. He mentions old problems resurfacing. Strange creatures where there shouldn’t be. Patterns he has seen before and hoped never to see again. He explicitly says that if he is wrong, he will send them back out into the world with coin and apologies.

This matters. He does not frame this as destiny. He frames it as responsibility.

He encourages them to form an official adventuring party and take guild work in Stonebridge through Marrek. He frames this as a way to stay active, earn coin, and “keep an eye out” for unusual disturbances. He is careful not to sound paranoid.

Early Act I Jobs — Normal Problems, Wrong Details

The first few jobs should be extremely grounded.

Escort work. Clearing creatures from farmland. Investigating disappearances near roads. Minor ruin delves. Nothing that screams “ancient evil.”

The trick is that something is always slightly off.

Creatures are behaving oddly rather than aggressively. Monsters appear in places that make ecological sense, but not historical sense. Ruins respond to magic in unstable ways. Old wards flare and then die completely when disturbed.

When the party succeeds, things get quieter than expected. Not resolved. Quieter.

This trains the players to associate success with uneasy calm.

Seal-Adjacent Activity Without Seal Language

During Act I, the party should interact with seal effects, never seals themselves.

Near Highreach-adjacent regions, tremors, minor cave-ins, or “stone sickness” reappear despite the Grandfather’s past repairs. Dwarves comment that the stone feels tired.

Near Greenwood Verge and Greenwood Forest, fey influence increases in bursts rather than gradually. Druids feel magic spike and vanish. Animals flee areas that used to be safe.

Near trade routes tied to Stonebridge, fortune swings wildly. One caravan prospers. Another is inexplicably ruined. Crime increases, then vanishes when guards arrive, then resurges elsewhere.

None of this is presented as one problem. It is presented as many unrelated ones.

The Grandfather’s Role During Act I

The Grandfather does not travel with the party yet.

He stays in Greenrest, researching, writing letters, consulting old contacts, and growing more concerned. Occasionally he sends the party questions rather than instructions. He asks them what they felt during encounters, not just what they fought.

He is slowly realizing that his mental model of the world is failing, but he does not yet know why.

By the end of Act I, he begins to express doubt in a way he hasn’t before. Not panic. Doubt.

Act I End Condition

Act I should end not with a catastrophe, but with a realization.

The party completes a job that should have permanently resolved a problem tied to a known region, but instead causes a new disturbance somewhere else. Not immediately. Days or weeks later.

This is when the Grandfather admits something he hasn’t said aloud yet.

He has seen this before.
And last time, he fixed it.

That line should land quietly. No exposition dump. No revelation yet.

Just the sense that the solutions they are applying might be part of the problem.

What the Players Believe at the End of Act I

They believe the kingdom is under strain.
They believe ancient systems exist and are failing.
They believe the Grandfather once saved the world from something similar.
They believe they are helping him do it again.

All of that is true.

They just don’t yet know the cost.
