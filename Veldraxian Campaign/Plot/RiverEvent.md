DM Summary — The River Event

What the Event Was

Fifteen years ago, a single smuggling operation along the Veldrun River collapsed with consequences far greater than anyone involved understood at the time. What began as a routine criminal job escalated into a violent confrontation involving rival gangs, hidden patrons, royal authorities, and ultimately the Grandfather himself. This incident is the shared fracture point in the lives of Quenlith, Shadow, and Tolin, marking the end of their coordinated criminal paths and the beginning of their quiet, divergent reforms.

The Job

The operation involved the illegal transport of a massive cache of explosives moving down the Veldrun River toward the kingdom’s heartlands. The true client never appeared in person, communicating only through intermediaries. The scale of the shipment was unusual, too large to conceal within ordinary trade barges, forcing the smugglers to attempt a dangerous maneuver by slipping two small boats into a legitimate merchant flotilla already underway.

Quenlith led one of the boats with a trusted partner. The second carried the remainder of her crew. Unknown to them, Shadow, then leader of a rival river gang, had learned of the shipment and decided to seize it rather than allow Quenlith’s group to profit and expand their influence. At the same time, the kingdom’s authorities in Highriver were already closing in, having quietly hired the Grandfather to dismantle escalating smuggling violence along the river without disrupting commerce.

The Ambush on the Water

As the boats entered the fleet, Shadow’s operatives moved. One vessel rammed Quenlith’s boat into the riverbank, damaging it and forcing a close-quarters confrontation. Cloaked figures boarded her craft, attempting to steal the explosives mid-river. Quenlith and her companion fought them off long enough to transfer the cargo to the second boat, which fled across the river and vanished into the night.

That escape was only partial. Guards, alerted by the chaos, pursued the fleeing smugglers. The explosives were discovered hidden at the cottage of an associate who had agreed to store them. That associate was arrested and imprisoned, severing one of Quenlith’s last personal ties to her former life and leaving a wound that has never fully healed.

Quenlith herself escaped the river that night, abandoning one of Shadow’s operatives when the guards overwhelmed the boats. The river was secured, the flotilla searched, and the smuggling ring shattered.

Shadow’s Capture

Shadow was not so fortunate. With both gangs exposed and violence undeniable, the authorities moved decisively. Shadow was arrested in the aftermath as an instigator and known criminal figure along the Veldrun. This marked the abrupt collapse of his power and the end of his gang. The sentence would have been severe, but the Grandfather intervened.

Having been hired to resolve the situation, the Grandfather argued that Shadow’s curiosity and intelligence could be redirected rather than wasted. The authorities, eager to avoid further disruption, allowed Shadow to be placed under the Grandfather’s supervision instead of imprisonment. This mercy became the first crack in Shadow’s former worldview.

The Client Revealed

The explosives belonged to Tolin, though none of the smugglers ever knew her name at the time. When the shipment failed to arrive, she demanded restitution. When none could be given, she sent enforcers after those she believed responsible. Quenlith, already isolated and injured from the river disaster, was hunted through the outskirts of Highriver.

It was there, during an assault by Tolin’s agents, that the Grandfather intervened a second time. He drove off the attackers, tended Quenlith’s wounds, and offered her refuge. Exhausted, hunted, and hollowed out by the river’s fallout, she accepted.

Not long after, the Grandfather sought out Tolin herself. Revealing both his identity and their blood relation, he convinced her to abandon her violent trade. She never learned that Quenlith had been responsible for the lost explosives, and Quenlith never learned that the client whose cargo she failed to deliver was the woman she would soon live beside.

Aftermath

Within months, all three former criminals were gathered under the Grandfather’s roof in Greenrest, though they arrived by different paths and with different wounds. Shadow departed first, guided toward the Southern Monastery to learn discipline and restraint. Quenlith stayed longer, struggling toward a quieter life while never fully severing her old instincts. Tolin lingered briefly, tasting a calm she had never known before eventually drifting north to Lakehold.

None of them ever spoke openly about the river again. Each carries a different truth about that night, none of them complete. For the Grandfather, it was the last time he acted openly against the kingdom’s criminal underworld. For the others, it was the moment their old lives ended, not by choice, but by collision.

DM Use

The River Event is a shared, unstable memory. It can resurface through old enemies, imprisoned associates, unresolved grudges, or the discovery of who truly hired whom. If the truth of Tolin’s lost shipment ever comes to light, it has the potential to fracture trust within the party or deepen it, depending on how forgiveness is earned.
