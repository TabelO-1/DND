### Premise

The Kingdom of Veldraxi is a quiet, modest realm of rolling fields, winding forests, and scattered hills. Life here is simple, the dangers small and few enough that an adventurer can make a living helping townsfolk, hunting monsters, or taking on odd jobs. The king rules in the capital but for most, matters of the crown are far from your mind.

What matters to you is the man everyone calls the **Grandfather**.

Years ago, when you were struggling to find your place in the world, he took you in. He saw your potential long before you did. He paid for your training or gave it himself, he supported your ambitions, and gave you both guidance and a home. Whether you learned the ways of spellcasting, the discipline of the guard, the teachings of the church, or another path entirely, you would not be who you are without him.

Since then, time has carried you away into your own journeys. Now you stand at second level, experienced enough to be capable, yet still early in your adventuring life.

And then the letter arrived.

Written in his familiar hand, sealed with his simple crest. A message short and urgent, asking you to return to his home at once. He speaks of a matter too important to write down, something he insists must be discussed in person, something he fears cannot wait any longer.

For the first time since he guided your early steps, the Grandfather needs you. What awaits in your former home is unclear, but the call is unmistakable. Whatever lies ahead, it will shape not just your future, but the future of the entire Kingdom.

### Opener

When the players arrive, the Grandfather will attempt to tell them of the Kingdom's Corruption and how the people in the north starve but the Royal Army comes. The PCs are allowed to flee only by the Grandfather's intervention, sealing their escape. They are given his bag, with a note to find a Marrek in Stonebridge.

They Flee, travelling north to Stonebridge, learning they are wanted by the Kingdom, but the descriptions are vague, not enough for them to be pinned down.

### Stonebridge

They find that with no local reputation with the Adventurer's Guild, they are not trusted, but after completing a few jobs eventually they will be introduced to Marrek.
Marrek tells them more about the Grandfather's past (once a great adventurer), and they show him the Grandfather's signal and tell him of the events that befell them. He offers more information and guidance "remain here, continue to be adventurers. I will investigate the rumors of where he could have gone." Marrek will get information as to the Noble that ordered his capture. He hosts an invite only event every year at his Palace. The party's goal is to get invited, either as staff or with another ground, or get directly invited.

Throughout this they will see the suffering of the people. Children without enough food to eat, corrupt guardsmen, nobles, and other corruption at the cost of the people of the realm.

### Noble's Party at Crownspire

The Noble will be rather forthcoming about the PCs questions. Answering some things clearly, others vaguely. He will speak of the Grandfather, who opposed the Crown and his decisions. He knows the Grandfather was alive, but not where he was imprisoned. He does however know he was taken after being taken to his palace.

### Inbetween???

???

### Destruction of Stonebridge

The Party attempts to defend the city with the troops but are overwhelmed as the Royal Army takes and destroys the city. They learn the King has ordered its destruction. The Forming Nobles Rebellion decides that now is the time to strike against the king. Your task is now to eliminate the king.

### Grand Conclusion

The Party storms the Throne Room, expecting to find the King, but instead they find the Grandfather resting on the throne, greeting them fondly, telling them the time of the King's corruption was over. He asked that they join him, take over the kingdom, dismantle the corrupt institutions that left the people starving. They learn that the Grandfather had been acting as king for some time, and had ordered the destruction of Stonebridge, claiming that it was necessary to force a rebellion to tear down the kingdom and that they would arise from the top of it, to rule. A battle will commence if they don't join him, between the party if the answer is split, and if with the Grandfather, against the Royal Guard.
