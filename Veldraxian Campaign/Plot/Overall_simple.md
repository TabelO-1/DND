### Premise

The Kingdom of Veldraxi is a quiet, modest realm of rolling fields, winding forests, and scattered hills. Life here is simple, the dangers small and few enough that an adventurer can make a living helping townsfolk, hunting monsters, or taking on odd jobs. The king rules in the capital but for most, matters of the crown are far from your mind.

What matters to you is the man everyone calls the **Grandfather**.

Years ago, when you were struggling to find your place in the world, he took you in. He saw your potential long before you did. He paid for your training or gave it himself, he supported your ambitions, and gave you both guidance and a home. Whether you learned the ways of spellcasting, the discipline of the guard, the teachings of the church, or another path entirely, you would not be who you are without him.

Since then, time has carried you away into your own journeys. Now you stand at second level, experienced enough to be capable, yet still early in your adventuring life.

And then the letter arrived.

Written in his familiar hand, sealed with his simple crest. A message short and urgent, asking you to return to his home at once. He speaks of a matter too important to write down, something he insists must be discussed in person, something he fears cannot wait any longer.

For the first time since he guided your early steps, the Grandfather needs you. What awaits in your former home is unclear, but the call is unmistakable. Whatever lies ahead, it will shape not just your future, but the future of the entire Kingdom.

# Campaign GM Summary — *The Breach Beneath Veldraxi*
## Core Truth (GM Only)

Thousands of years ago, an extraplanar breach formed between the Material Plane and another hostile plane of existence. Through this breach exists one ancient extraplanar entity, unable to fully cross without a powerful anchor. The ancients did not destroy it; instead, they built a distributed containment system of seals across the land to delay its arrival.

The seals were never meant to be permanent. They were designed to degrade slowly, bleeding pressure harmlessly over centuries.

The Grandfather’s Past Mistake

During his adventuring career, the Grandfather and his party encountered failing seals and extraplanar disturbances. Believing the system was simply breaking down, they repaired and reinforced the seals, successfully halting the threat.

This worked — but it was a mistake.

By restoring the seals beyond their intended lifespan, they:
• Prevented natural pressure release
• Forced the breach creature to adapt
• Compressed centuries of instability into decades

The Grandfather unknowingly accelerated the final breach.

He retired believing the danger ended.

## Campaign Starting State (Level 2) - Act I

The breach is active but incomplete.
The creature cannot fully cross.
The seals are drawing strong monsters and extraplanar anomalies.

The Grandfather knows:
• An ancient power is rising
• It is tied to the seals
• He is no longer strong enough to face it alone

He does not yet know:
• The seals cannot be permanently repaired
• He caused the acceleration
• He will become the vessel

He asks the party to:
• Form an adventuring party
• Grow stronger
• Take guild work (Stonebridge, via Marrek)
• Occasionally investigate seal-related disturbances

Others would believe him mad.

## Mid-Campaign Truth (Level 4–5) - Act II

The party uncovers ancient records revealing:
• The seals were meant to degrade
• Repairing them increases pressure elsewhere
• The system is obsolete in a centralized kingdom

The Grandfather realizes the truth alongside them:
• His earlier success caused this crisis
• The breach cannot be fixed
• The entity is adapting and waiting

This breaks him — but clarifies his resolve.

## The Final Plan (Level 6–7) - Act III

The seals cannot stop the breach anymore.
The entity needs a powerful living anchor to cross fully.

It chooses the Grandfather:
• He is magically attuned to the seals
• He has bound it before
• He is the strongest available vessel

The Grandfather travels with the party to the central ancient dungeon, built as a last-resort confrontation site. He intends to bring the entity somewhere it can be ended.

## Final Revelation & Boss Fight - Act IV

Inside the dungeon:
• The entity partially crosses
• It possesses the Grandfather
• It cannot fully manifest yet

The Grandfather retains enough control to tell the party the truth:

If the entity fully crosses, it will be unstoppable.
While its essence is bound to him, it can be banished.
The only way is to kill him.

This is true.

**Final Battle**

The party fights the possessed Grandfather, not the creature directly.
• He actively resists the entity
• He weakens himself to help them
• The environment shows planar instability

When he is slain:
• The entity is forcibly banished
• The breach collapses
• The seals burn out, their purpose fulfilled

The threat is ended for this age.
