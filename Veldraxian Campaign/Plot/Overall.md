# Opener

The campaign opens with the party’s return to the Grandfather’s village, a place that feels smaller than they remember, quieter, familiar in a way that carries both comfort and unease. He welcomes them warmly, insists they stay for dinner, and for a brief moment the world feels normal again. The conversation is gentle at first, nostalgic even, but there is a tension beneath his words. He speaks of movement in the kingdom, of forces shifting, of change that can no longer be ignored. He tells them that he needs them now, more than he ever has before.

Before he can explain what he means, the sound comes.

Boots on stone. Metal on wood. Shouted orders. The kind of noise that does not belong in a quiet village.

When the party looks out the window, they see the Royal Army flooding the streets. Soldiers move with practiced urgency, seizing villagers, overturning carts, forcing doors open. Banners of the crown hang from armor that feels suddenly oppressive. This is not a patrol. This is a purge.

The Grandfather’s demeanor changes instantly. The warmth vanishes, replaced by urgency and fear sharpened by certainty. He tells them the army has come for him, and by extension, for anyone tied to him. There is no time to argue. No time for questions. He orders them to move.

He leads them down into the basement, where they see the first hint that he is more than a retired adventurer. From a hidden chest he retrieves his staff, worn but powerful, a necklace he treats with unmistakable reverence, and a small bag he hesitates over before leaving behind. His hands shake—not from fear, but from the weight of a choice already made.

When they emerge outside, the escape collapses.

Royal soldiers pour into the space, weapons raised. A captain steps forward, composed, authoritative, and utterly uninterested in negotiation. He declares the Grandfather under arrest by order of the crown. The charge is left vague. Dangerous. Treasonous. Enough to justify force.

This is the moment where players feel the tension of choice—but the world makes it clear how uneven the field is. The army is overwhelming. This is not a winnable fight.

The Grandfather does not hesitate.

He gives the party his bag, them feeling the weight of it, his grip tight, eyes locked with theirs. He tells them to run. He tells them not to look back. He promises that the soldiers will not follow as long as he still stands.

Then he produces the scroll.

Those who know magic recognize it immediately. Those who do not still feel the danger radiating from it. Delayed Blast Fireball—magic meant for destruction, not escape. He speaks a final command, not to the army, but to the party. Go. Live. Get stronger.

The spell ignites behind them as they flee.

They do not see the battle, but they hear it. Explosions that shake the ground. Arcane detonations ripping through the night. Shouts turning to screams. The unmistakable sound of an army trying—and failing—to contain a single, terrifyingly powerful magician.

By the time the noise fades, the village is burning behind them.

The Grandfather is gone.

What remains is silence, ash drifting on the wind, and a single piece of paper clutched in trembling hands—the first thread of a journey that will define everything that comes next.

## The Bag and Trip

“Go to Stonebridge. Find Marrek. He will help you survive what comes next. I am sorry. Show him the symbol.”

The Bag contains a few things. Firstly, the above note, secondly a symbol, the same symbol on the Grandfather's letters, a map of the kingdom, and three magic scrolls (unable to be deciphered yet (Teleport, Fireball, Mass Cure Wounds))

This is a good moment to teach the players what it means to be fugitives without turning the journey into constant punishment or paranoia. The key is to make their wanted status feel real but imprecise, something that exists in the background and occasionally presses in, rather than something that dominates every scene.

On the road to Stonebridge, the message should come through indirectly. No dramatic proclamation, no guards immediately kicking in doors. Instead, the world feels subtly altered.

As they travel, they begin to notice signs that something has changed. In the first village they pass through, a crude notice is nailed to a post near the road. It bears the royal seal, but the description is laughably vague. It speaks of “a party of four adventurers,” possibly armed, possibly dangerous, wanted for questioning in connection with treasonous activity. There are no names. No races. No clear details. The reward is modest, suggesting the crown wants information more than blood.

The important thing here is tone. This is not a manhunt yet. It is bureaucracy catching up to chaos.

When they stop at an inn, conversations hush just a little when armor clinks or a staff is set against the wall. A nervous innkeeper asks where they’re coming from, not because he knows who they are, but because travelers are suddenly suspicious. A pair of local guards pass through the common room, glance at them, then move on. They are looking for someone, but not these four in particular.

As they continue, rumors drift in. A caravan driver mentions trouble near a village to the west. A farmer complains about soldiers “asking too many questions.” Someone mutters that the King’s men are nervous lately, that something big must be happening. None of it points directly at the party, but all of it reinforces the same truth: the crown is unsettled, and unsettled crowns look for scapegoats.

Mechanically, this gives you space. The players are wanted, but not hunted. They can still enter towns, still take jobs, still interact with the world, but now there is tension under every choice. Do they give real names, or aliases? Do they wear their gear openly, or travel a little more quietly? These decisions emerge naturally without you forcing them.

The map in the bag helps ground this phase. It gives them certainty in direction while the world around them grows uncertain. Stonebridge becomes a destination not just because the note says so, but because it represents answers, shelter, and the first place where someone might actually understand what is happening.

Most importantly, the vagueness of the wanted notice protects your long-term story. If later you decide the crown tightens its grip, the descriptions can sharpen. Names can appear. Sketches can circulate. If the party becomes famous or infamous, the notice can evolve with them. Right now, it is just the beginning of a narrative pressure curve.

By the time they reach Stonebridge, the players should feel like they are still free, but no longer invisible. The kingdom has noticed something is wrong. It just hasn’t figured out who yet.

### Jobs along the way

That instinct is exactly right, and it fits both pacing and player psychology extremely well. The trip to Stonebridge is the transition from inciting incident to campaign proper, and letting the party take on a few jobs along the way does three important things at once: it normalizes adventuring, gives them time to grow into their roles, and slowly layers in the consequences of being quietly wanted.

The key is that these jobs should not feel like distractions. They should feel like life continuing under pressure.

As the party travels, they quickly realize that moving at full speed is exhausting, expensive, and risky. Supplies run low. Horses need rest. Injuries need tending. Unless they are deliberately pushing themselves, stopping in small towns and roadside settlements becomes natural rather than forced. In these places, work is still work. Monsters still threaten roads. People still need help. The kingdom does not stop just because something is wrong at the top.

Early jobs should be simple and familiar. Clearing wolves from a road. Escorting a merchant wagon through a forested pass. Investigating strange lights near an old ruin. These encounters remind the players who they are right now: low-level adventurers earning coin and reputation one task at a time. This grounding is important before the political and moral weight of the campaign fully sets in.

At the same time, you quietly weave in the larger context. A merchant they escort complains about increased tolls or inspections by royal soldiers. A village elder mentions that a local hedge wizard was arrested “for questioning.” A bandit group turns out to be deserters, not criminals, fleeing increased conscription. None of these moments require exposition. They simply make the world feel unsettled.

Being wanted should occasionally matter, but not constantly. Perhaps a job offer is withdrawn when guards arrive unexpectedly. Perhaps a payment is delayed because a local official wants to verify identities. Perhaps a job goes sideways when a nervous employer fears being associated with adventurers. These moments teach the players that their status has consequences, but not so severe that they feel punished for engaging with the game.

Crucially, some jobs can offer choices rather than danger. A local magistrate might ask them to help with a problem that indirectly supports the crown. A rival group of adventurers might be openly loyalist, dismissing the party as suspicious drifters. These moments let the players begin defining their relationship with the kingdom long before the truth is revealed.

Stonebridge remains the long-term goal throughout this journey, always present on the map, always drawing closer. Every job completed brings them nearer, not just geographically, but narratively. They grow stronger. They gain confidence. They begin to feel like a real party rather than survivors fleeing a burning village.

By the time they finally reach Stonebridge, the players should feel that they earned it. They didn’t sprint blindly to safety. They lived in the world, learned its rhythms, and discovered that even while being quietly hunted, there is still good to be done, gold to be earned, and people worth helping.

## Stonebridge - Start

That instinct is solid, and tying Marrek to the Adventurer’s Guild is one of the cleanest ways to pace Stonebridge without it feeling artificial or gamey. The trick is to make the delay feel like earned trust, not a level gate the players can see through.

Stonebridge should feel like a city that moves on its own rhythms. When the party arrives, it’s larger than anywhere they’ve been since the village burned. Bridges over a wide river, layered districts, stonework worn smooth by centuries of trade. Adventurers are common here, but they are not automatically important. That matters.

Finding Marrek should not be immediate. His name is not whispered on every corner. When they ask around, reactions vary. Some people shrug and say the name sounds familiar. Others stiffen and suggest they stop asking questions. One guild clerk might recognize the name but insists Marrek hasn’t been seen in weeks. This establishes him as someone who exists on the edges of legitimacy.

Eventually, the Adventurer’s Guild becomes the common thread. Not because Marrek is openly listed, but because the guild is where information flows. Jobs are posted. Names circulate. Reputations are tracked. The party quickly realizes that if Marrek is anywhere in Stonebridge, someone in the guild knows how to reach him.

The Guild, however, does not treat them as special.

They are low-level adventurers with no local reputation, vague answers about where they came from, and an uncomfortable air of urgency. The guild does not refuse them, but it does not trust them either. They are offered work. Real work. Dangerous enough to matter, small enough to be deniable. This is Stonebridge testing them.

As they take on guild jobs, a few things happen naturally. They gain experience and reach level three. They build a small but visible reputation. Their names begin to circulate in side conversations. A guild handler starts assigning them jobs directly instead of pointing at the board. The city begins to recognize them as reliable rather than merely present.

Only after this shift does Marrek enter the story properly.

The meeting should feel deliberate. Not a coincidence. Perhaps a guild representative finally tells them that someone wants to speak with them privately. Perhaps they are given an address, or a time, or a location that feels intentionally neutral. When they meet Marrek, he already knows who they are. He knows they came from the village. He knows what they carry in the bag. He knows they were watched when they arrived.

When they show him the Grandfather’s symbol, the tone changes immediately.

This is where the delay pays off. Marrek does not test their strength with combat; he tests it with patience. He needed to know whether they could survive in the open world without being reckless, whether they could keep secrets, whether they could resist the urge to force answers. By waiting until they reached level three, you let the characters grow into people Marrek can actually involve in something dangerous.

From a story perspective, this also reinforces the Grandfather’s foresight. He didn’t send them to Marrek to be rescued. He sent them to be tempered. Stonebridge is the forge.

 - 

When they finally sit down with Marrek, it isn’t in a public hall or guild office. It’s somewhere quiet. Somewhere chosen. He listens more than he speaks at first, watching them with the practiced eye of someone who has survived long enough to distrust coincidence.

When they show him the symbol, everything changes.

Marrek doesn’t touch it immediately. His expression hardens, then softens into something heavier. Recognition, regret, and a trace of fear all pass across his face before he finally exhales.

He tells them the truth, carefully.

The Grandfather was an adventurer once. Not a hedge mage. Not a wandering scholar. A real adventurer. A powerful one. One of the strongest Marrek ever knew. He wasn’t just competent — he was dangerous in the way that only people who understand every kind of magic become. Not devoted to a single discipline, but endlessly curious, endlessly prepared.

Marrek tells them that he used to travel with him. That the symbol they carry was their party’s mark, worn openly in another age. It wasn’t famous, but among the right people it was respected. Feared, even. He emphasizes one thing clearly: the Grandfather would never give that symbol away lightly. If it’s in their hands, it means something has gone catastrophically wrong.

He admits that before the Grandfather vanished, they had been speaking. Quietly. Carefully. About things that shouldn’t have been moving, beginning to move again. About pressure inside the kingdom. About the crown acting strangely, even dangerously. And then, suddenly, the messages stopped.

No warning. No explanation.

When the party explains what happened in the village, Marrek doesn’t interrupt. He lets them tell it all. The soldiers. The captain. The spell. The explosions. The escape. The bag.

By the time they finish, Marrek is silent for a long moment.

When he finally speaks again, his voice is lower.

He tells them that if the Grandfather chose to stand and fight an army, then whatever the crown claims, this was not a misunderstanding. It was not an arrest. It was a removal. And if the Grandfather believed the party needed to run rather than surrender with him, then he knew this was bigger than all of them.

Marrek does not say the Grandfather is innocent.

He also does not say he is guilty.

What he does say is that the Grandfather was never careless, never sentimental, and never wrong about when it was time to move pieces on the board. If he sent them away with that bag, then they were meant to survive long enough to matter.

Marrek leans back then, studying them anew.

He tells them that whatever game the kingdom is playing, they are now part of it. Not because they chose to be, but because the Grandfather chose them. And that choice carries weight.

He ends with a warning, not a command.

If they continue down this path, there will come a day when they learn things about the man who raised them that they may not be ready to hear. When that day comes, Marrek won’t tell them what to believe.

He will only ask what they intend to do with the truth.

Marrek’s guidance should feel practical, cautious, and grounded in experience. He is not sending them to overthrow the kingdom or rescue the Grandfather. He is buying time.

After hearing their account, Marrek makes it clear that whatever happened in the village has not finished unfolding. Armies do not move that decisively without ripples. Arrests like that create paperwork, witnesses, rumors, and mistakes. Those mistakes take time to surface, and Stonebridge is exactly the kind of place where such information eventually leaks.

He tells them plainly that running now would be a mistake. Moving too fast would draw attention. Asking the wrong questions would get them killed. If they want answers, they need to become unremarkable first.

Stonebridge offers that opportunity.

Marrek explains that the city sits at the crossroads of trade routes and river traffic. Soldiers pass through. Messengers stop overnight. Guilds hear things long before the crown realizes they’ve been overheard. Adventurers come and go without raising suspicion. If the party embeds themselves here, working openly, taking contracts, and building a reputation as reliable but ordinary adventurers, they gain two things at once: cover and access.

He proposes a simple arrangement. They stay in Stonebridge. They work through the Adventurer’s Guild. They take jobs that make sense for their level and skill. In return, Marrek keeps his ears open. When rumors surface about arrests, transfers, sealed roads, or unusual royal movements, he brings those fragments to them. Not answers. Pieces.

He is careful to frame this not as a favor, but as preparation. If the Grandfather is alive, reckless action will only worsen his situation. If he is dead, charging blindly toward the crown will only add more bodies to the pile. Either way, the party needs strength, reputation, and information before they take their next real step.

This also lets Marrek test them one last time. Not their loyalty, but their discipline. Can they live with uncertainty? Can they do good in the world without immediately chasing the truth they crave? Can they grow stronger without announcing themselves?

Before they part, Marrek gives them one final, quiet directive. If anyone ever asks about the village, about the Grandfather, or about the symbol, they deny everything. They are adventurers for hire. Nothing more. Nothing less.

## Noble
This is a perfect pivot point, because it turns the story from investigation into aspiration. The question is no longer “what do we do next,” but “what kind of people do we need to become to stand in that room.”

The invite-only nature of the event is the lock. The campaign between now and that party is the key.

Marrek explains that this gathering is not merely a celebration. It is a convergence of power. Nobles, financiers, guildmasters, clergy, and carefully chosen outsiders attend. Deals are made there that never reach parchment. Alliances shift over wine and music. The noble’s presence is guaranteed because the event is as much about being seen as it is about enjoyment. Absence would be noticed.

But adventurers do not receive invitations simply for being brave.

So Marrek reframes the problem for them. You do not break into this kind of party. You are invited into it, or you enter under a role so legitimate that no one questions why you are there.

From here, the campaign opens into a long, satisfying middle arc where the party earns their way inside without ever feeling railroaded.

One path is reputation. Over time, the party becomes known in Stonebridge and beyond as reliable problem-solvers. They take contracts tied to trade routes, noble holdings, or sensitive matters. Eventually, a patron notices them. Not the noble himself, but someone who will be attending the event and needs capable protection, discreet muscle, or deniable assistance. When that patron receives an invitation, the party comes with them, not as guests, but as necessary professionals.

Another path is service. The event requires staff beyond the noble household: performers, guards, arcane specialists, healers, inspectors, escorts. These roles are filled quietly through guilds and intermediaries. With the right references and timing, the party can secure temporary positions tied directly to the event. They are not meant to socialize. They are meant to be invisible. That invisibility is exactly what gives them access.

A third path is leverage. Over the course of their Stonebridge work, the party uncovers something valuable. A secret someone attending the party would rather not see exposed. A problem that needs to disappear before the event begins. An artifact, document, or truth that buys an invitation where gold would fail. This path is dangerous, but it teaches them how power bends when pressed correctly.

Marrek does not tell them which path to take. He tells them something more important.

The event is months away.

That time is not a delay. It is an opportunity.

He urges them to think long-term. To build connections intentionally. To listen for names that repeat. To notice who complains about the noble, who profits from him, and who fears him. Every job they take, every ally they make, every favor they earn can move them one step closer to that palace without anyone realizing what they are truly aiming for.

He also warns them that once they step inside that party, everything changes. Words spoken there cannot be taken back. Eyes will remember them. If they fail, they may leave with nothing but confirmation of the kingdom’s corruption. If they succeed, they may leave with answers powerful enough to put a target on their backs forever.

Getting in is not the challenge.

Getting out with the truth is.
