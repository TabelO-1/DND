### Character Summary: Shadow
Fullname: "Shadow Drifting at the Edge of Dawn"

After becoming an adult, Shadow naturally shifted toward the criminal underworld. That's where he'd eventually find himself leading a small gang of smugglers along the Veldrun River. He had met Quenlith, leading her own smuggling gang, and were tentatively peaceful. That was until he heard that she had a big score, and he decided to take the score for himself instead of allowing his rival to get ahead of him. The Operation went south fast, as the two gangs fought, the Grandfather appeared. Their two gangs had caught the attention of the authorities, but had proved elusive, however the authorities in Highriver had hired the Grandfather to take care of the issue, who was towards the end of his adventuring days.

Shadow was arrested, along with both of the gangs being scattered. Quenlith was able to flee. The Grandfather, knowing the Tabaxi's curious nature, he stated his case to the authorities that had hired him, requesting to take Shadow into his care. They obliged and granted his request, with Shadow being eternally grateful (saved from being a cat in a cage) and wished to learn more about the Grandfather and the reasons for his kindness. They travelled around for a few months more before the Grandfather took in Quenlith too, and not long after Tolin as well. They would then travel south to Greenrest, to the Grandfather's home.

Ultimately after a few months, the Grandfather suggested Shadow go to the Monastery south of Greenrest and become a monk, which he would, learning a better way of life and new combat skills. That was fifteen years ago. Shadow would end up keeping in touch with both the Grandfather and Quenlith.

### Information Told:

**Tabaxi Heritage**: As a Tabaxi, you know well of Tabaxi culture, and you know well of the Tabaxi Town in the foothills near the Serevan River, you left when you joined the world to sate your curiosity. When visiting towns, you know where to look for any fellow Tabaxi, if any are there.

**Criminal Heritage**: As a former smuggler, your criminal heritage gives you insight on how the criminal underworld works, even fifteen years removed from it. In cities you visit you understand how to listen to the right rumors, understand coded language, and locate black markets or underworld contacts without drawing the wrong attention.

**Kingdom of Veldraxi**: Your knowledge of the Kingdom is largely that you learned firsthand after leaving joining the wider world. You are particularly knowledgeable of the Veldrun River, your gang having operated out of Highriver and Rivergate. You know these cities are the core of the Kingdom's Economy, and you know how much of the economy is dependent on illegal goods. Along the river are a number of trade cities, the most significant being Veldrun City. This city is the midpoint along the river, and many trading barges stop there. The Kingdom's influence here is strong, and the city is surprisingly well controlled for how far it is from the capital, the Kingdom's influence here is just as strong as it is in its core cities. At the end of the River is Grayhaven, a stone port city and one of the Kingdom's most Northern and Western towns, here control is sloppy, and you had an easy time smuggling goods through the city in your old days.

**Elven Kingdom**: You know of the Elven Kingdom, based in Lethariel, but the region itself is far, and you have never visited it personally. You know very little beyond that.

**The Southern Monastery**: The Southern Monastery is a day's walk south of Greenrest and part of the Order of the Monk. The Southern Monastery is the second smallest of the five Monasteries. The Order of the Monk is not a influential organization in the kingdom, but rather runs in the background, unnoticed by most. Through your time in the order you know of the five monasteries the order operates, they are:

The Central Monastery, Located in the Elderward Forest, and only allows Monks that have been with the organization for a decade to know of its location. You know of its location but have never visited. They specialize in the **Way of the Astral Self**.
The Northern Monastery, located in the Crownfrost Mountains, west of the Crownfrost Lake. This is the most secluded and smallest of the Monasteries, home to a few dedicated monks. This monastery follows the **Way of the Ascendant Dragon**.
The Eastern Monastery, located in the Harth Region nearest to a farming village and the largest Monastery. They teach the **Way if the Four Elements**.
The Southern Monastery, in the Greenwood Verge Region. Known for its focus on teaching new combat skills as well as the ways of the Monk. They teach the **Way of the Kensei**.
The Western Monastery, on the Eldermere Peninsula. This Monastery is also home to a number of elves, being located in the Elven Kingdom. They learn the **Way of the Open Hand**.
