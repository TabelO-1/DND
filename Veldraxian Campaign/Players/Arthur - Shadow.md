### Character Summary: Shadow
Fullname: "Shadow Drifting at the Edge of Dawn"

After becoming an adult, Shadow naturally shifted toward the criminal underworld. That's where he'd eventually find himself leading a small gang of smugglers along the Veldrun River. He had met Quenlith, leading her own smuggling gang, and were tentatively peaceful. That was until he heard that she had a big score, and he decided to take the score for himself instead of allowing his rival to get ahead of him. The Operation went south fast, as the two gangs fought, the Grandfather appeared. Their two gangs had caught the attention of the authorities, but had proved elusive, however the authorities in Highriver had hired the Grandfather to take care of the issue, who was towards the end of his adventuring days.

Shadow was arrested, along with both of the gangs being scattered. Quenlith was able to flee. The Grandfather, knowing the Tabaxi's curious nature, he stated his case to the authorities that had hired him, requesting to take Shadow into his care. They obliged and granted his request, with Shadow being eternally grateful (saved from being a cat in a cage) and wished to learn more about the Grandfather and the reasons for his kindness. They travelled around for a few months more before the Grandfather took in Quenlith too, and not long after Tolin as well. They would then travel south to Greenrest, to the Grandfather's home.

Ultimately after a few months, the Grandfather suggested Shadow go to the Monastery south of Greenrest and become a monk, which he would, learning a better way of life and new combat skills. That was fifteen years ago. Shadow would end up keeping in touch with both the Grandfather and Quenlith.
