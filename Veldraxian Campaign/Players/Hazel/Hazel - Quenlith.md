### Character Summary: Quenlith

Born into a life of crime as Quill. Her parents were smugglers, and she began to help on jobs during her youth, learning the trade from a young age. When she became an adult she became Quenlith (at 83) and went off to peruse her own life of smuggling. 

In time, she joined a smuggling group (of 4) and started to get involved with bigger jobs. During this time she would meet Shadow, tabaxi leader of a rival gang as they made money by smuggling goods on and off ships. Eventually, the group took on a big job, moving a large shipment of illegal goods on the Veldrun River. Unfortunately, the job went south, as Shadow realized this would be a big score for his rival and sabotaged the mission. Then the Grandfather, who had been hired to take care of the group crashed the party. Quenlith's smugglers stashed the goods, hoping to at least make the delivery late when the person who was stashing it was caught and imprisoned. 

The client (Tolin) was less than happy, demanding recompense for the lost shipment, when they couldn't repay, their enforcers were sent after the remaining three. Quenlith had been backed into a corner, when the Grandfather intervened. He scared off her perusers, and took Quenlith in for a number of years, teaching her a new way of living, ending her life of crime. The Grandfather was also with Shadow (the meeting was tense), and would later pick up his Grandniece, Tolin. The two never realized that in their past lives, it was Tolin that Quenlith owed for the lost shipment. That was 15 years ago. 

After a number of years with the Grandfather, Quenlith left to live in the Greenwood Forest, slowly teaching herself the ways of the Ranger. She would occasionally visit the towns of the Greenwood Verge, and kept up with Shadow, however she never completely stopped smuggling, rarely accepting the occasional job.
