### Character Summary: Tolin Kamalamai
Born in Eldermere, her mother died during childbirth. Her childhood was difficult, her father was an alcoholic, chronically drunk, and abusive too. One day she had enough and killed her father. When she tried to sell the home, she ran into trouble but she cared little as she went on to become a pirate, leading her own ship eventually. Her skills as a captain made her proficient as a bard, knowing the way of the song (sea shanties). 

Seeing an opportunity for money and conflict, she got into the explosives business. One day she was shipping a large number of explosives illegally. The job went south however, and her transporters lost the goods. She would then learn of the Grandfather, who despite being younger than her was technically her Great Uncle. One of her great grandparents (an elf), having sired a half-elf (the Grandfather). They would meet, and the Grandfather would take her away from her life of crime. She would meet Shadow and Quenlith at the same time, and travel south with him to Greenrest. That was fifteen years ago.

She would live a few years in Greenrest with Quenlith (Shadow having since departed to a Monastery). She would then travel to Lakehold, where she would become a bartender and, on the side, pick up the ways of the druid.

### Information Told

**Birthplace**: As an elf you were born in the Elven Kingdom, either in Eldermere or Lethariel.

**Grandfather**: Fifteen years ago, your life would change, when you met the Grandfather and learned he was your Great Uncle. You chose to leave behind your life of piracy and crime behind, joining with him, Quenlith, and Shadow, meeting them for the first time. You lived in Greenrest for some time with Quenlith, Shadow only staying months before moving to a Monastery. This period of your life was calm, which almost no drama. Eventually you would leave Greenrest behind, travelling north, finding a home in Lakehold, where you would become a bartender and quietly began to learn druidcraft.

**Pirate Background**: As a former pirate, you know the Velymar Sea well, you know of the kingdoms across the sea, and have visited them. You also know of the Saltward Isles, an island chain in the Sea. Those who live here are governed by no kingdom, a neutral hub where Kingdoms and Dignitaries can meet on equal ground. 

In the kingdom, you are well familiar with the port cities of Eldermere, Port Valen, and Grayhaven. Each port has its character, but all of them share the same undercurrents, trade flows through these cities, but so does illegal goods, being smuggled into the kingdom.

**Criminal Background**: Your criminal past gives you great insight into how the criminal underworld works, even fifteen years removed from it. In any port city you visit, you know how to listen to the right rumors, understand coded language, and locate black markets or underworld contacts without drawing the wrong attention. You need no introductions to this world, you know it well.

**Kingdom of Veldraxi**: Your knowledge of the Kingdom is rather limited. You know of the great cities and the distant capital to the north, though you have never travelled their personally. Your understanding of the kingdom comes secondhand, from sailors, merchants, and your time in Lakehold. You know of and have been to places like Lakehold, Stonebridge, and Port Valen. You understand that the kingdom is a kingdom of huamns for humans. Other races are exlcuded or looked down upon, but rather not accounted for in the laws and governance of the kingdom.

**Elven Heritage**: As an elf born in the elven kingdom, you would know well of the Elven Kingdom. Elven influence still runs deep in its tradition, culture, architecture, and memory, but it is no longer absolute. In Eldermere, a city under the firm control of elven authority for most of your life, it is increasingly governed and influenced by the Kingdom of Veldraxi and its human laws. The change has been slow, gradual over time, and many elves resent their slipping power, but most do such quietly, in private conversations.

As an elf, you know of the city most humans don't: Iltheria. Following the road southwest of Lethariel across the Eldermere river and into the Greenwood Forest, you come across **Iltheria**, a wood elf city. It largely unknown to humans and kept a secret. The city represents what elven independence once looked like, secluded, self-sufficient, and resistant to outside rule. It is the last of the hidden elven cities.
