### Character Summary: Quenlith

Born into a life of crime as Quill. Her parents were smugglers, and she began to help on jobs during her youth, learning the trade from a young age. When she became an adult she became Quenlith (at 83) and went off to peruse her own life of smuggling. 

In time, she joined a smuggling group (of 4) and started to get involved with bigger jobs. During this time she would meet Shadow, tabaxi leader of a rival gang as they made money by smuggling goods on and off ships. Eventually, the group took on a big job, moving a large shipment of illegal goods on the Veldrun River. Unfortunately, the job went south, as Shadow realized this would be a big score for his rival and sabotaged the mission. Then the Grandfather, who had been hired to take care of the group crashed the party. Quenlith's smugglers stashed the goods, hoping to at least make the delivery late when the person who was stashing it was caught and imprisoned. 

The client (Tolin) was less than happy, demanding recompense for the lost shipment, when they couldn't repay, their enforcers were sent after the remaining three. Quenlith had been backed into a corner, when the Grandfather intervened. He scared off her perusers, and took Quenlith in for a number of years, teaching her a new way of living, ending her life of crime. The Grandfather was also with Shadow (the meeting was tense), and would later pick up his Grandniece, Tolin. The two never realized that in their past lives, it was Tolin that Quenlith owed for the lost shipment. That was 15 years ago. 

After a number of years with the Grandfather, Quenlith left to live in the Greenwood Forest, slowly teaching herself the ways of the Ranger. She would occasionally visit the towns of the Greenwood Verge, and kept up with Shadow, however she never completely stopped smuggling, rarely accepting the occasional job.

### Information Told:

**Criminal Heritage**: As a former smuggler, your criminal heritage gives you insight on how the criminal underworld works, even fifteen years removed from it. In cities you visit you understand how to listen to the right rumors, understand coded language, and locate black markets or underworld contacts without drawing the wrong attention.

**Kingdom of Veldraxi**: Your time as a smuggler in the Kingdom has taught you much. As you spent most of the time along the Veldrun River, and in cities such as Highriver and Rivergate, that is where most of the knowledge lies. You know those two cities are the core of the Kingdom's economy, where trade flows in and out, but you also know how much of that economy is dependent on illegal goods. Along this river are a number of trade villages, but most notably is Veldrun City, along the midpoint of the river, making it a natural stopping point for many voyages on the river. The city is well controlled and governed by the crown, unusually so for a city so far from the capital. At the end of the river as it feeds out to the Veylmar Sea is Grayhaven. It is a stone town with sloppy governance, locals in the pockets of gangs and smugglers. The city is a gateway for any one wanting to ship illegal goods or illegally ship goods into the Kingdom.

**Elven Heritage**: As an Eladrin, you are a rare even among the elves, touched by the feywild. However you grew up in Eldermere, where your parents likely still smuggle to this day. Elven influence still runs deep within the Elven Kingdom ruling from Lethariel, however in the years since you have left Eldermere, you know that while elven culture, tradition, and architecture is prominent, the city has fallen under considerable influence from the Kingdom of Veldraxi despite formally being an elven city. Many elves resent this change, however most only discuss so privately.

In addition, you know of a city most humans don't. Southwest of Lethariel and across the Eldermere river lies **Iltheria**, a wood elf city. It is largely unknown from humans and kept a secret. The city represents what elven independence once looked like, secluded, self-sufficient, and resistant to outside rule or change. It is the last of the hidden elven cities. From your cottage in the Greenwood Forest, the city is only a few days walk, though to anyone who isn't a ranger or wood elf, the journey would like take much longer.
