### Character Summary: Tolin Kamalamai
Born in Eldermere, her mother died during childbirth. Her childhood was difficult, her father was an alcoholic, chronically drunk, and abusive too. One day she had enough and killed her father. When she tried to sell the home, she ran into trouble but she cared little as she went on to become a pirate, leading her own ship eventually. Her skills as a captain made her proficient as a bard, knowing the way of the song (sea shanties). 

Seeing an opportunity for money and conflict, she got into the explosives business. One day she was shipping a large number of explosives illegally. The job went south however, and her transporters lost the goods. She would then learn of the Grandfather, who despite being younger than her was technically her Great Uncle. One of her great grandparents (an elf), having sired a half-elf (the Grandfather). They would meet, and the Grandfather would take her away from her life of crime. She would meet Shadow and Quenlith at the same time, and travel south with him to Greenrest. That was fifteen years ago.

She would live a few years in Greenrest with Quenlith (Shadow having since departed to a Monastery). She would then travel to Lakehold, where she would become a bartender and, on the side, pick up the ways of the druid.
