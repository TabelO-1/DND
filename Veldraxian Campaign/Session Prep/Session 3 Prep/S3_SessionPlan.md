Shadow Returning: Infomring the Party that he had tracked and killed the last Goblin.

Entering Greenwatch Crossing:

Town Square: A Host of buildings surround the town square. The Mayor's Home, A Chapel, The General Store, The GWC Guildhall, and Traveler's Inn.

Approach
“As you approach, the wooden palisade of Greenwatch Crossing rises into view. The wall stands no more than ten feet high, practical rather than imposing, with a gate facing each cardinal direction. Smoke rises from clustered chimneys near the center, while the outskirts remain scattered and open.”

Inside
“The buildings cluster tightly around a central square. The farther you move from it, the more space opens between homes and workshops. To the north, the scent of cut wood dominates — the lumberyard stretches wide, stacked with timber ready for trade.”

The Guards will stop the players, clarifying if they had just come from the south. When they confirm (hopefully) they will ask about Goblins on the Road that was reported, and when they inform them they killed some Goblins, the Guard will remark that an expedition from the Guard was going to be sent out soon. One of them goes off to the Guard Station to Inform the Captain. They will ask if the party is adventurers, and may mention the Guildhall in town.

Two Guards, Older and Younger 40/20.

PC Response

PC Response

OG Nods to the YG who leaves, if asked, he will tell them that he will inform the Captain.

OG "Saves us some trouble. You lot adventurers?"
PC Response

YES (Or Maybe): OG: "Guildhall has work posted tied to that, if you're interested to make a little coin." 

**IF they stop at the Guildhall:**

A few notice boards are sitting behind a counter with a woman standing behind it. These boards denote local quests, registering information, and adventuring gear the Guildhall sells.

If they register here: Inform them they will have to stay overnight to complete the process. Explain Renown (Starting at Provisional Rank / Local Rank). Issue them their Guild Card, requring a Party Name & Leader.

Jobs (IF they want):

Escort Quest: Escort a Merchant to Stonebridge
Aid in the Guard's Expedition to rid the southern road of Goblins
Clear wolves from the forest where lumber is gathered

**Leaving:** Crossing the Serevan River. A bridge leads across the river North.
About a day's journey north in a small town called Jelbin Crossroads. The town sits on two roads meeting. One goes North, to Stonebridge, the other East to the Elven Kingdom. Often Shorthandedly refered to as "The Crossroads"

Past The Crossroads is the path to Stonebridge, a two day journey that will require camping out. As they continue to travel north(west), they will see the Standing Stone Mesas jutting out of the ground hundreds of feet into the air, considered impossible to climb by most.

**Stonebridge**:
IF we get to Stonebridge because we just skip past everyone: A large town, maybe 10000 residesnts. You cross the stonebridge (over the Valenreach River) the town is named after, come past patrols of Guards on the way in, a long line awaits entrance for carts. The town has tall stone walls that are easily 40 feet tall. Looking back south across the Valenreach River you can see the Standing Stone Mesas hundreds of feet into the air, North of the City is the Elderward, with trees almost a Hundred Feet tall even at the forest's border, residents will whisper of people getting lost in there, never to be seen again.

The Stonebridge Guildhall makes the GWC one look tiny. Many adventurer's travel through this area, and you can clearly see a number of adventurer's whom look considerably stronger than you, alongside a large number of ones whom look more similar to your level. Entering it and registering will require a wait of about half an hour. The registration process is the same as above.
