We are playing DND 5e, I'll generally be using 2014 rules (as that's the sourcebooks I have) but I'll render judgement on which version of the rules to use in specific scenarios when necessary.
You will all be a 2nd-Level Character, and the only requirement for your backstory is that is connects to the grandfather and receiving help towards your current class. Beyond that, go crazy (or be normal? Up to you). If you have any specific questions or want to run something by me, DM me. I don't have too much made right now, but I'm thinking I should have enough for a session zero soon.

Characters Stats: 4d6 drop the lowest.
Milestone Advancement.

Crit Rules: Take the max damage for an attack roll (and modifier) and then roll for damage after that.
