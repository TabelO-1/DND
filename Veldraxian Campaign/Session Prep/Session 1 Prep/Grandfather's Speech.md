He waits until the house has settled. Until plates are pushed aside, the fire crackles softly, and the room feels safe enough that no one is watching the door.

Then he speaks.

“I didn’t call you here because I wanted company,” he says, voice calm but tired. “And I didn’t call you here because I miss you. Though both of those things are true.”

He looks at each of you in turn, not hurriedly.

“Something is stirring, something old, older than this kingdom, older than human arrival in these lands. Even older that most of the stories they tell children to keep them in bed at night."

He rests his hands on the table, fingers interlaced, but you all notice they shake from his age.

“I’ve felt it before. Not recently, many decades ago. Long enough that I convinced myself it was finished.”

He pauses shortly.

“I was wrong.”

He does not elaborate yet.

“There are structures in this land that were never meant to be seen, let alone understood by most folk. Safeguards. Containments. Call them seals, if you like. They were put in place to keep something bound.”

He meets your eyes now, steady and unflinching.

“Those seals are weakening.”

He raises a hand slightly, forestalling interruption.

“Not broken. Not failing. But strained. And when such things strain, they draw attention. Creatures, Monsters. Distortions. Events that feel… wrong, even when you can’t explain why.”

He exhales slowly.

“I have tried to investigate. I have tried to intervene. And for the first time in my life, I have had to accept a truth I do not like.”

His voice is quieter now.

“I am no longer strong enough to face this alone.”

A faint, apologetic smile.

“That is why I’m asking you to do something simple. Something honest. Something dangerous in its own way.”

He folds his hands.

“Become an adventuring party. Take work. Travel the kingdom. Grow stronger. Learn what the world is becoming before it breaks.”

Then, softer, almost to himself:

“And when the time comes… I need to know I didn’t face this future alone.”
