### General World Information:

You all live in the Kingdom of Veldraxi, a relatively young realm of rolling grasslands, broad rivers, and long established roads. Two great forests fall within its borders, the ancient Elderward in the centerlands, and the Greenwood Forest farther south. King Veldane the Fifth rules from the great city of Veldspire in the far north, though for most common folk the kingdom is experienced not through the crown, but through local lords.

Two major rivers shape life across the kingdom. The Valenreach runs through the center of the realm, while farther north flows the Veldrun, which now carries a majority of the trade in the kingdom. Barges carry grain from the Harth Region south of the capital, supplying much of the kingdom’s food. These two rivers meet at the city of Rivergate, where they combine into a single great waterway that continues north toward Veldspire. Rivergate is the most populous city in the kingdom and where a great deal of its wealth is concentrated. Not far upriver lies Highriver, the second most populous city, serving as another major center of trade and commerce.

Following the rivers westward toward the sea, numerous trading towns dot their banks. Along the Veldrun, the most notable is Veldrun City. Along the Valenreach, Stonebridge sits near the  center of the kingdom and serves as a major crossing and trade hub. From there, the rivers continue on to the great port cities of Port Valen on the Valenreach and Grayhaven on the Veldrun, where trade meets the waters of the Veylmar Sea.

Southeast of the rivers lies the Highreach Region, a land of hills and broken mountains. A narrow route between Highreach and the Greenwood Forest crosses the Serevan River and leads into a quieter part of the kingdom known as Greenwood Verge. Following this road south eventually brings one to the small village of Greenrest, home of the Grandfather.

South of Stonebridge, and west of the Greenwood Forest, lies the Elven Kingdom. Its capital is the city of Lethariel, and its influence extends westward to Eldermere and south into the mist-shrouded Southshore Veil. While relations between the Elven Kingdom and Veldraxi are generally peaceful, the elves govern their lands by their own customs and laws.

The kingdom itself is predominantly human. Other peoples live within its borders, but human law and tradition prevail. Elves largely remain within their own realm. Dwarves are most commonly found in Highreach and in Stonehold, working mines and stone. Halflings are a familiar sight in the farming communities of the Harth Region.

The Adventurer’s Guild holds modest but notable influence throughout the kingdom, maintaining guild halls in every major city. Through these halls, adventurers are guided toward work that serves the needs of the realm, whether that be escort, exploration, or dealing with threats beyond the reach of ordinary folk.

There are places everyone knows to avoid unless desperation leaves no other choice. The Warding Weald is avoided entirely, known to turn travelers around or them never being seen again. The Southshore Veil is perpetually misted and wrapped in rumor, widely believed to be haunted. Far to the southeast lies the Sunscorched Desert, considered nearly impassable by most humans and home to a single enduring city where no one species dominates. To the far north are frozen lands where cold and dragons alike are said to claim the unprepared.


There are some places everyone knows to avoid unless you are desperate. The Warding Weald is avoided entirely, turning travelers around or them disapearing completely. The Southshore Veil is shrouded in mist and rumor, considered haunted by most. To the far southeast is the Sunscorched Desert, considered untravelable by many humans, making its only major city a hub with no dominant species. To the far north is cold, dragon infest lands, enough to keep most away.
