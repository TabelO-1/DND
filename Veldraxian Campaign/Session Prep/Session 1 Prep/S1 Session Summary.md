# Session One:
The four of you had slowly trickled into town, each deciding to stop at Stefan's Tavern. Aeris, Tolin, and Quenlith all met up, realizing they were here for the same reason. Shadow watched and overheard but decided to wait outside for the others. Aeris left first, meeting Shadow and discussing their same mission, followed shortly by Tolin and Quenlith. They all went to the Grandfather's House, with Tolin kicking the door in (Uh rude?).

After a moment, the Grandfather came out, greeting each of you fondly, speaking to each about their lives since he has last seen them. Dinner was then served (after an hour of terrible cooking). Over dinner the Grandfather spoke of why he had called them: an adventure of his past he thought long done has begun to act up again, but it's still in its early signs. He spoke of ancient protections that kept something not of this world from getting in, and now they were again weakening. He tried to investigate, but he has had to come to the conclusion that he is simply too old to face this threat alone. 

However there is time, he asked each of you to grow stronger, to form an adventuring party and complete guildwork that would strengthen them, so when the time came for intervention, the party was strong enough to stand with the Grandfather. They all then went to bed, two staying with the Grandfather, and two at the tavern (was the plan then someone slept in a tree and the other someone slept on the dining room table). In the morning over breakfast, after grumbling about being forced out of the kitchen, he suggested they go to the Stonebridge Guildhall (Of the Veldraxian Adventuring Guild) and meet Guildmaster Marrek there to start their career. Marrek was an old party member of the Grandfather's that once faced the same threat. The party agreed, though with some dissent from Tolin. They now await Shadow's return, gone to his monastery a half day's run south.

### DM NOTES:

**General Notes:**
The name is Aeris, not Aegis

**Meeting the Grandfather (Again) - Character Interactions**

Note: the other two didn't have the greatest chance to interact, as Tolin and Shadow bickered back and forth a lot. 

Aeris: Maintained his distance, was generally quiet and less familial with everyone, as he met them for the first time. 
Quenlith: Also didn't talk much, but her interactions was that of loyalty with to Grandfather. Was also very conscious of his elderly state.
Shadow: Was very friendly with the Grandfather, on more than one occasion, giving him a hug. Was very interested in listening to him.
Tolin: The interrupter and immature one. She interrupted the Grandfather with rude comments, always one to speak her mind. She clearly is attached to the Grandfather, in her own way (being rude) she displayed general rebellion against him, but also conformed, and yet was very clear on not allowing him to strain his old body. 

**Quick Summary**: 

The Grandfather is old, and one of his past victories was not so. Ancient Seals weakening, and the grandfather is weak (I played him a little weaker than my notes would suggest, without his staff he gripped counters for balance, but Tolin made it much more dramatic appearing to the other PCs, even though it was meant to simply show age), and their goal is to become an adventuring party.

**Grandfather State**: Happy to see those he knows well, glad to cook for them even if he's terrible at it. He's worried about the failing seals but is confident they will succeed. 

**Successes:** 
I had worried about the dialogue feeling too monologue-y, but the natural interruptions of Tolin allowed for speech to get across as more natural. I was also able to handle impromptu random immature statements with grace. 

**Work on it**: Allowed too many pauses for Tolin to interrupt, some are good but not too many. Work on remembering dialogue better and spend less time glancing at my reference material / script.
