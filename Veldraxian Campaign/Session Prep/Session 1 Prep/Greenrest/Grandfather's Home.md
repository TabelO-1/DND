# Outside

The Grandfather's home sits at the edge of the village, a small pathway worn from being walked on leads to his door. At first glance it looks like an old but well kept farmhouse with a stone foundation, upper levels made from timber, and a sloped roof patched and repaired over deacdes.

Then you notice the tower, rising from one corder of the structure is a narrow stone spire, taller than the rest of the building by a story. The tower is obviously older than the rest of the building, which would have been built around it. Narrow windows spiral upwards.

The yard surrounding the home is tidy, but obviously lived in. Herbs grow in marked plots, some of which are mudane, but some are arcane components. Wind chimes made of carved crystals hang from the door way, clinking a melodious tune whenever the wind catches them.

# Inside

The inside of the home feel warm and familar, you all having once spent time here. Bookshelves line nearly every wall, overflowing and unorganizied.

In the main hearth, a fireplace dominates the wall with three doors leading further into the building. You know where each door leads, the left door leads upstairs, the central door to the Kitchen and Cellar, and the right door leads to the Tower. Inside the room, on the left side lies a table large enough to seat five. On the left, under a window inbetween the bookshelves is a small desk, books and notes scattered over it.
