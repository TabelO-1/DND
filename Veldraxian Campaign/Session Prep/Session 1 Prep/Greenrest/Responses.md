**“If these seals exist… why haven’t the king, the Adventurer’s Guild, or the great libraries heard of them? Why is this just now becoming a problem?”**

“Because these structures are older than the crown, older than the Guild, older even than the libraries they trust to preserve truth.”

“Each of those institutions has fragments. References. Half-records buried under newer histories. None of them see the whole shape of it.”

He rests a hand more firmly on his staff.

“And neither do I.”

“I know that the seals exist. I know that they were meant to contain something dangerous. And I know that they are straining now.”

“What I do not know — and what troubles me — is whether anyone ever truly understood them completely… or whether we have been inheriting a system we only pretend to comprehend.”

**“You said you’ve tried to investigate and intervene already. What exactly did you do… and what went wrong?”**

“Years ago,” he says, after a pause, “my adventuring party was drawn to a number of ruins. Places that had begun to attract monsters and… wrongness.”

“At the heart of one of them, we found a seal. Ancient. Damaged. Strained, much like I am describing now.”

His grip shifts slightly on the staff.

“We did what adventurers do. We cleared what had gathered around it. We studied it as best we could. And using what knowledge we had, we repaired it with magic.”

He looks up, meeting your eyes.

“At the time, it worked. The disturbances faded. The creatures stopped coming. We believed the matter resolved.”

A quiet exhale.

“What I do not understand… is why similar signs are appearing again. Whether the seals are weakening naturally, or whether something else is pressing against them now.”

“Only that whatever was contained is no longer content to remain quiet.”

**“If you repaired one of these seals before and it worked… why not just do it again? Why send us out instead of fixing this yourself?”**

He does not answer immediately. Instead, he rests both hands on his staff, as though grounding himself before speaking.

“Because what we are seeing now are early signs,” he says carefully. “Small disturbances. Echoes of something larger, not yet fully revealed.”

“When we dealt with a seal before, we were drawn to it by obvious danger. We knew where to go. We knew what we were facing.”

He lifts his eyes to you.

“That is no longer the case.”

“I do not know where every seal lies. It is evident now that there are more of them than my party ever realized — scattered, hidden, and quiet until something stirs them.”

His grip tightens briefly.

“I could set out again. I still know the magic. But I am not the man I once was.”

“If monsters have begun to gather — and I believe they have — then I would be risking failure, not merely danger.”

He straightens as much as his age allows.

“That is why I am not asking you to repair anything yet.”

“I am asking you to grow strong. To learn how these disturbances manifest. So that when the time comes — when a seal must be confronted — we are not arriving blind, or alone.”

**“How long do we have?”**

He is quiet for a long moment before answering.

“I don’t know,” he says plainly.

“Last time… the warning signs were subtle. Easy to ignore. We only realized how long things had been building after they could no longer be ignored.”

His eyes drift briefly to the fire.

“I don’t know how long the disturbances were present before we intervened then. Months. Years. Longer, perhaps.”

He looks back to you, expression serious but controlled.

“What I do know is this: the signs I am seeing now are familiar.”

“That tells me we are not at the beginning.”

A pause.

“But neither do I believe we are at the end.”

**“You took us in. You trained us. You say you trust us. So why does this feel like you’re sending us away instead of standing with us now?”**

He doesn’t look away when you say it. If anything, his expression softens.

“Because I will need you,” he says quietly. “Just not all in the same place.”

He shifts his hands on the staff, steadying himself.

“I will not be idle here. I will be reading, listening, writing to old contacts who still owe me favors. If there is knowledge to be found, I intend to find it.”

He looks at each of you in turn.

“And I will send what I learn to you, as often as I am able.”

A pause.

“I am not sending you away because I doubt you.”

“I am asking you to go because the world is larger than this house, and whatever is stirring is not kind enough to announce itself where I can watch it comfortably.”

His voice lowers, gentler now.

“I will not command you to do this. If you choose to return to your homes, to your lives, I will not judge you.”

“But if you go… then when the time comes, we will not be strangers to what we are facing.”

**“What happens if we ignore this and nothing comes of it?”**

“Then I will count myself a fool,” he says quietly, “and be grateful for it.”

“And I will be proud to know that whatever else came of this… you became a capable adventuring party because of it.”

2.

**“Why us specifically? There are stronger adventurers out there.”**

“Perhaps there are,” he says. “But I do not trust them with uncertainty.”

“And most of them would dismiss me as an old man seeing patterns where none exist.”

3.

**“If things go wrong… will you tell us the whole truth then?”**

“Things will go wrong,” he says calmly.

“And when I understand as much as I am able… I will tell you everything I know.”
