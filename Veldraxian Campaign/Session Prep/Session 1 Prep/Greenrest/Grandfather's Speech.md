He waits until the house has settled. Until plates are pushed aside, the fire crackles softly, and the room feels safe enough that no one is watching the door.

Then he speaks.

“I didn’t call you here because I wanted company,” he says, voice calm but tired. “And I didn’t call you here because I miss you. Though both of those things are true.”

He looks at each of you in turn, not hurriedly.

“Something is stirring, something old, older than this kingdom, older than human arrival in these lands. Even older that most of the stories they tell children to keep them in bed at night."

He rests his hands on the table, fingers interlaced, but you all notice they shake from his age.

“I’ve felt it before. Not recently, many decades ago. Long enough that I convinced myself it was finished.”

He pauses shortly.

“I was wrong.”

He does not elaborate yet.

“There are structures in this land that were never meant to be seen, let alone understood by most folk. Safeguards. Containments. Call them seals, if you like. They were put in place to keep something bound, something that does not belong fully in this world.”

He meets your eyes now, steady and unflinching.

“Those seals are weakening.”

He raises a hand slightly, forestalling interruption.

“Not broken. Not failing outright. But strained. And when such things strain, they draw attention. Creatures. Distortions. Events that feel… wrong, even when you can’t explain why.”

He exhales slowly.

“I have tried to investigate. I have tried to intervene. And for the first time in my life, I have had to accept a truth I do not like.”

His voice is quieter now.

“I am no longer strong enough to face this alone.”

He does not sound afraid when he says it. Just honest.

“And even if I were, I do not yet understand the full shape of what is happening. I know that something ancient is pressing closer. I know it is bound to these seals. What I do not know is how far this will go, or how quickly.”

He straightens slightly.

“That is why I have not asked you to fight it. Not yet.”

Instead, he folds his hands.

“I am asking you to do something simpler, and far more important in the long run.”

“Become an adventuring party. Travel. Take work. Grow stronger. Pay attention to the world beyond this village.”

His gaze lingers on each of you in turn.

“When you encounter things that feel out of place — monsters where they do not belong, magic that behaves strangely, ruins that should have remained quiet — I want you to remember them.”

A pause.

“Bring what you learn back to me.”

Then, softer — not as a command, but a confession.

“I have spent my life believing that problems can be solved if you find the right spell, the right knowledge, or the right blade.”

“I am beginning to suspect that this one will require more than that.”

The fire pops. The house settles.

“And when the time comes,” he says quietly, “I would rather face the truth of this threat alongside people I trust… than discover too late that I misunderstood it alone.”
