# Main Personality

A man who has already proven everything he ever wanted to prove.

He does not posture, or threaten. He does not remind others of his many great acomplishments. His authority comes from calm certainty, not force.

When he disagrees, he does so gently.

When he is worried, he does not use drama, he reduces in his words, speaking less, which makes people lean in.

Physically, he moves carefully, not weakly. He does not shuffle nor tremble unless exhausted. His age shows patience not fraility.

Emotionally, he is warm yet reserved. He cares deeply, but life has taught him not to cling. When he looks at the party, he has great pride for them - for what they've accomplished and for what he sees they will become.

Most importantly, he never looks like someone waiting to die. He looks like someone who believes the world can be set right, if he understands it well enough.

This is his greatest strength, and eventual flaw.

# With PCS

With **Aegis**, he speaks as a fellow scholar. He asks questions rather than gives answers, nudging him toward conclusions. He respects Aegis’ discipline and restraint, and when he offers praise, it is rare and meaningful. He will frame the threat in terms of knowledge lost, systems misunderstood, and mistakes made by those who thought they were fixing things.

With **Quenlith**, he is careful not to sound disappointed. He acknowledges who she was without judging it, and focuses on who she chose to become. He frames the danger as something that preys on people trying to escape their pasts. He trusts her instincts implicitly, even when they conflict with law or tradition.

With **Shadow**, he is quietly proud. He never mentions chains or cages directly, but he often speaks of freedom, discipline, and choice. He treats Shadow as someone who understands consequences deeply, even if he once embraced them. He will ask Shadow to watch, to notice what others miss.

With **Tolin**, his tone softens more than with anyone else. Not patronizing—familial. He does not lecture her. He worries about her. He frames the coming danger as something that destroys homes first, not kingdoms. When he asks her to help, it is the closest he comes to pleading.

# Staff

At his side rests a tall wooden staff, its surface darkened and polished smooth by years of use. It is carved from a single piece of old wood, slightly twisted, as though it grew that way rather than being shaped. Faint runes spiral along its length, worn soft with age and handling, their magic subtle rather than showy. Whatever power it holds is restrained, patient, and enduring.

The head of the staff is capped with a simple metal band that cradles a dull crystal, cloudy rather than brilliant. It does not glow. It does not pulse. It simply exists, heavy with quiet purpose. This is not a symbol of rank or ceremony. It is a tool that has seen real use.

**Use**

When the party last knew him, the staff was something he carried.

Now, it is something he uses.

Let him lean on it when he listens. Let him rest both hands on it when he speaks about the seals. Let him straighten slightly, almost unconsciously, when he talks about the future and what must be done. The contrast tells the story for you: age has claimed his body, but not his purpose.

And later, much later, when that same staff is raised in anger or desperation, the players will remember this version of him — steadying himself, choosing hope.

If you want, next I can help you decide whether the staff has a quiet, mundane enchantment now or whether it’s secretly bound to the seals themselves, waiting to matter.
