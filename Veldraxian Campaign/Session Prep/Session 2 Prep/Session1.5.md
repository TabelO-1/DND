### Arthur (Shadow)'s Monastery Trip:

After travelling back to the Southern Monastery, you ask around about the Grandfather. A few know of him as a man who lives in Greenrest, the closest town to the Monastery, but you are directed to the Head of the Southern Monastery.

The Head knows little of the Grandfather personally, but knows of him from his adventuring days and that he is now retired in Greenrest. Upon being asked upon a great evil sealed away, one from outside of this world, he responds that throughout history, a great many evils have been sealed away, but he would have to research about an evil from outside of this world.

Shadow then goes on to explain what details he knows of this evil, which admittedly is not much and tells the Head how to contact him upon the completion of his research upon Shadow's behalf. *To contact Stefan and informed him to deliver it to "Phantom"*.

You also asked what use the Monastery's could be to adventurers, which the Head told you it was a place to rest, to gather supplies, and perhaps a small library (Which is open to outsiders to stay at). Also it was mentioned that as a long-term member of the Order of the Monk, the Monastery may be more willing to aid you than other members.
