## Village Arrival

Shadow Arrives back from the Southern Road, bringing greetings to the group. Mostly player interaction.

### Grandfather's Goodbye

As you all gather to leave, perhaps after breakfast, the Grandfather will speak. Something along the lines of:

"Before you go" "I know what it means to set out like this." "Watch out for one another, not just in a fight, I should know all too well how fatigue can make a fool of anybody"
"Disagree with eachother if you must, argue about your decisions, but never walk away from another because of it." "You don't need a name or a banner yet, simply become a party, the rest will come with time."
"And when you return to me, hungry, injured, or convinced you've made a terrible mistake, my door shall always be open." **Humor** "Try not to break anything important before then".

### The Road North

The road is simple, an ill traveled path, but the beaten path never fades. Along the way, trees, small hills and rocks are along the path. As you approach the rest village, about a day's walk, you'll notice its small, few people come this way, about the size of Greenrest.

## Middle Town (Hedgeward)

A small village, no larger than Greenrest. Few people come this way, mostly local traffic to and from Greenwatch Crossing, you can get a place to stay at the local tavern for free, as locals.

### Ambush on the Road

As the road goes on, eventually you come into a small canyon, no more than 100 meters long with two hills making up each side. As you enter through, goblins will come around both sides in an ambush. 

5 Goblins will ambush the party, four goblins and one goblin boss. 7(4) + 21 HP, means a total of 49 enemy hit points. And reducing the damage from the goblins to 1d4+2 except for the boss. I don't want anyone getting hurt much. Reducing AC by three overall for base goblins, these guys weak :).

## Greenwatch Crossing (End Point)

Greenwatch Crossing is a significantly larger villager than the two previous of it, hosting maybe 300-400 villagers, a branch of the adventurer's guild, local factions, an outpost of the Kingdom, local governance, taverns, farms, etc.
