# Session Two:

Following Shadow's return, the soon-to-be Party decided to spend that day in Greenrest, allowing Shadow to rest, whom had completed a day's trip there and back and spent time at the Monastery. In the following morning, breakfast was served, and not by the Grandfather's hand, as Quenlith and Tolin knew better than to allow him to cook. Following breakfast, you all prepared to leave Greenrest, and the Grandfather bestowed upon you his words of wisdom. He urged you to look after eachother, to allow disagreement without division, and to remember that becoming a party was more important than ranks, names, or banners. He added that his door would be open no matter the circumstance, though joked for you to "not break anything too important".

You all travelled north, stopping in Hedgeward and staying the Tavern free of charge. The Bartender, Travis, was slightly taken aback by Tolin's brazen requests and need to feed *Gary the Squirel* food by dumping it in her travel bag. Soon after dinner and a drink that reminded you that not all alcohol as terrible *cough cough Stefan's*. You all retired to your bedrooms.

In the morning you travelled north toward's Greenwatch Crossing, before you came across a small Canyon no more than 300ft across, as you passed the center, two groups of Goblins charged at you from both sides, five in total. The Battle was short, the two that approached from the South were destroyed by Aeris' and Tolin's magic, fire and ice.

To the North, one Goblin stayed back, firing an arrow that struck Shadow, who rushed forward, annihlating one Goblin, striking his head in and launching him flying, before continuing to trade blows with the Goblin Leader whom would eventually be struck down by Tolin's Vicious Mockery, when she proclaimed "At least my mother didn't abandon me." The psychic ended the creature where it stood.

Seeing his companions fall, the remaining goblin archer fled. Quenlith’s arrows narrowly missed as it ran, but Shadow pursued it for nearly five hundred feet before catching and killing it.

The ambush ended quickly. The party suffered minimal injury and recovered twenty-five copper from the fallen goblins.

### DM NOTES:

General Notes: The Session was sucessful. The party is beginning to learn and know about eachother. They are doing things together, even with Tolin's brazen personality, and Gary the Squirel. Tolin improved at random outbursts, more in line with personality traits over random interjections for a reaction.

**The Grandfather**:

He did good, providing advice not instruction. Reinforcing Party Cohesion and acting as an emotional guide, at least for some. His eventual loss will hit some hard, particuarly Shadow, who always embraces him upon arrival and departure.

**Combat**:

Combat showed how the party reacted, both in and out of the game. Some streamlining could be achieved by me, but how the expierenced players helped the newer ones was great, providing advice on how to do things, quickly answering questions with answers or looking them up.

**Quick Summary**:

Upon Shadow's return, the Grandfather provides advice to the party and they travel North. They spend a night in Hedgeward, before continuing to travel, they get ambushed by Goblins but easily defeat them.

**Successes**:

I had worried player action outside of the table with a limited time, but we managed to finish up just in time. Pacing is good, and there has been no narrative issues thusfar. Players are happy.

**Work On It**:

Combat, Initiative Tracker, and being prepared to have it all setup beforehand.

**Told**: The Seals affect the Monsters and Land.
