# Damien Cross' Attempt at Galactic Dominance Centered Around the Kuiper Belt's Mining Rights

## Part I: Beginning of Tension

The Venus Conglomerate has set it's eyes on the South Kuiper Station and controlling it. The other factions that have a stake in this manner do not want the balance of power to shift even further away from them.

AstroCorp, The Miners, and Government will employ competetive tactics to stop or slow them down and likely engage in subterfuge or espionage.

The Venus Conglomerate will deploy it's anti-espionage tactics and use it's power to force itself into Kuiper South.

## Part II: Advances of the Venus Conglomerate

The VC will almost certainly suceed at Kuiper South and now desire for Kuiper East and North. It will first target the Miners at Kuiper North and begin dismantling their operations and beginning a hostile take over. They will turn towards Kuiper East soon after prompting legal hearings about mining rights and the VC's hostile actions.

# Part III: Disregard of the Venus Conglomerate

As all interested parties host a meeting about mining rights at the belt they come to a decision that places one station in each person's hands. VC with West, Government with South, AstroCorp with East, and Miners North. 

All factions are amicable to this except the Venus Conglomerate whom in a surprising move decide to attack the meeting over Earth and attempts to wipe out the other factions. This will be an intense firefight between the Earth Government, a few ships from the other factions and the Venus Conglomerate's Fleet and mercenary pirates known as the Marauders.

# Part IV: Kuiper Belt War

As the Venus Conglomerate then attempts to conquer everywhere else the solar system is divided between the VC and it's few allies and everyone else. At this time the players would be highly involved in the effort, either for or against.
