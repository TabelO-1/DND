**Room III: The Frozen Floor**

*As the players emerge from the maze, they find themselves in a room with a frozen floor stretching out before them. The floor is divided into squares, arranged in a 10x10 grid. Each square seems to shimmer with a frosty glow. The air is cold, and the faint sound of cracking ice fills the room.*

**The Challenge:**

1. **Fragile Ice Squares:** Some squares in the grid are marked with a subtle, crystalline pattern, indicating that they are fragile. If stepped upon, these squares will break, and the unfortunate player will fall through into a perilous pit of deadly icicles below.

2. **Safe Passage Squares:** Other squares are reinforced and can bear the weight of a limited number of players. These squares allow safe passage for a brief moment, but exceeding the weight limit will also trigger a collapse.

**The Possessor of the Map:**

1. **Route Mapping:** The player who holds the map from the previous room has a pre-determined route marked on the frozen floor. This route leads through a series of safe squares and avoids the fragile ones. It is a strategic path that can guide the group safely across the frozen expanse.

2. **Decision to Share:** The possessor of the map must decide whether to share the route with the group or keep it secret. Sharing the route can ensure the safety of all, but the competitive nature of the challenge may encourage them to keep the information to themselves.

**Descriptions of the Frozen Floor Challenges:**

1. **Dynamic Movement:** Players must carefully plan their movements, coordinating to step on the safe squares while avoiding the fragile ones. The frozen floor is both beautiful and treacherous.

2. **Limited Safe Squares:** The number of safe squares at any given time is limited, requiring the players to strategize and move as a group to stay within the safe zones.

3. **Race Against Time:** The frozen floor is slowly melting, and players must navigate the grid efficiently. If they take too long, the ice beneath them will weaken, increasing the risk of falling through.

*The room presents a delicate balance between cooperation and competition. The players must work together to reach the end, but the possessor of the map holds a crucial advantage. Whether they choose to share the information or use it to gain a personal edge will significantly impact the group's success in crossing the frozen floor and obtaining the Christmas star.*

Floor III - Frozen Floor:
"Beneath the frost, a floor of cold,
Navigate wisely, secrets to unfold.
Ice may crack, peril be near,
But with unity, victory is clear."
