After a long break we come back to Session #7. To catch everyone up here's a little recap:

After having been recruited to colonize Mars by SpaceX in 2150 on the colony ship SPX-C-021, the team awoke in their cryochambers to the ship broken in several pieces. Wondering what happened the team explored and came across a recording from the Captain telling them the story of what happened:

*"I am Captain Elena Navarro, Captain of Colony Ship SPX-C-021. Time is a luxury I no longer possess. Our mission was noble: to pave the way for humanity's future on Mars, to script a new saga in our history. The destination we hurtle toward, the jump gate, has transformed into a looming specter of doom. A brutal testament to the tragic miscalculations that bind us to this fate.  May our ordeal stand as a somber lesson"*

Due to a series of miscalculations the ship crashed into the jump gate and broke into peices and was sent somewhere far away: Into the rings of Saturn.

The team fought through difficult challenges: A unfriendly crew member, disagreement in the team, a daunting spacewalk, and scrapping the ship for pieces to repair a shuttle: their only hope of escape. After repairing the shuttle the team went to the fragments of the bridge where they sent out a SOS beacon.

Unfornately they got some nasty gangsters in response who with the help of a NAT1 from a Box O' Weapons subdued the team and imprisoned them. After a few weeks of imprisonment the team has broken out of their prison and even charmed a few guards into helping them escape. Oh and Gavin is dead in his cell.
