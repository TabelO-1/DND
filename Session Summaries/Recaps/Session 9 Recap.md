So our recap for Session Nine is as follows:

After being recruited by SpaceX to colonize Mars in 2150 upon SPX-C-021 you all awoke in your cryochambers and the ship broken into several peices. After finding a recording from the Captain explaining how the ship crashed into the Mars Jump Gate where it was inexplicably sent to the rings of Saturn.

After the you explored the ship you were captured by the Marauders, a prominant pirate faction. After breaking out of jail and recruiting some guards you all commited some crimes against sentients and charmed and killed everyone in your path.

With some help from a good roll of the Box O' Weapons, Bryson managed to blow up some pirates and your guard friends and severly injured both Bryson & Boroka.
