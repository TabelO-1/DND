To TJ:
So as for Sylva, she's a operative for the Halfling Guild, which means she does covert missions for the guild which usually ended up being espionage on either the gangsters or the Venus Conglomerate. The last mission you did you got caught by the gangsters, before being saved by the party.

Now while you were usually kept at a hands distance from the actual purpose of your missions, you've always suspected that the halfling guild is helping one of the other major powers in the galaxy. Those are: AstroCorp, the Venus Conglomerate's biggest rival company, Coalition of Miners, a unionistic group with varying ideas and strategies united upon achieving better working conditions, or the Earth Government, a symbol of a bygone era that still desperately cling to power and order but don't have much influence outside of Earth's Gravity well.
