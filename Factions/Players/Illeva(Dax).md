Background: Acolyte:
Feature: Shelter of the Faithful
As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.

You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple.

DM Notes:
An undercover pirate, attempting to bring peace to the frontier.
She(?) wants to side with all factions to make everyone happy.
A peace monk, only helping the pirates to allow them to get what they want.
They would react if the pirates couldn't be satisfied and began war.

Guardian of the Sea Interaction:
Firstly you must be near a source of water greater in size than a gallon. More water = more this deity can do.
Second, you must pray to your god, using an action and succeed for something to happen. The DC will vary by what you are attempting to accomplish.
Thirdly you must spend time in the game devoting yourself to your god, doing things in its name, praying to it, etc.. Despite your deep and long devotion it will take time for the response of meaningfulness. This is for a reason: despite the devotion, your character has been gone for some time.
