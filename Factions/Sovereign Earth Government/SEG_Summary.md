# Sovereign Earth Government

**Description**:

The Sovereign Earth Government (SEG) is the ruling body that claims authority over the Earth Solar System. Although it projects an image of control and governance, its effectiveness has diminished due to prolonged periods of inactivity and instability. As Earth became largely uninhabitable, the government shifted its focus to managing the remaining habitable zones and maintaining control over off-world assets.

**Faction Goal**:

To reassert its former control and influence over the solar system's territories and its populace, recovering its lost authority and stabilizing its governance structures.

**Faction Alignment**:

Lawful Evil – The SEG operates with a focus on order and control, often resorting to authoritarian measures to maintain its rule and enforce its policies, regardless of moral considerations.

**HQ**:

 * **Earth Orbital Station**: The primary base of operations for the SEG, serving as a hub for administration and strategic command.

**Bases**:

* **Mars Governing Chamber**: A secondary base on Mars responsible for overseeing Martian affairs and maintaining influence over the Martian colony.
* **Luna Military Base**: A key military installation on the Moon, serving as a strategic outpost and military stronghold.
* **Earth Reclamation Zones**: Protection Zones on Earth where efforts are made to reclaim and rehabilitate parts of the planet's surface.

**Player Reputation**:

4 – Neutral. Players will interact with the SEG in a neutral capacity, with their reputation influenced by their actions and the SEG’s perception of their activities.

**Kuiper Belt Strength**:

3 – Weak. The Sovereign Earth Government holds limited influence in the Kuiper Belt, with minimal presence and control compared to other factions. They have a minor role in the region, with their strength mainly focused on maintaining strategic interests rather than exerting significant power.

**Additional Details**:

* Current Status: The SEG struggles with legitimacy and effectiveness due to past inactivity and the rise of powerful corporations and other factions.
* Administrative Challenges: Often seen as corrupt or ineffective, with many of its laws and regulations bypassed or ignored by other powers.
* Presence: Maintains a strong military and administrative presence in the solar system but faces significant challenges from rival factions and environmental conditions on Earth.
