Lucian Morrowbane's journey from a convict to the founder of the Venus Conglomerate is a testament to his unyielding ambition and cunning resilience. Born into poverty and deprived of educational opportunities, Lucian found himself drawn to the chaotic world of politics as a means of escaping his humble origins.

In his youth, he immersed himself in local politics, using his natural charisma and persuasive charm to rally support from disenfranchised communities. But as his influence grew, so too did his willingness to bend the rules to achieve his goals. Lucian's political career was marked by scandal and controversy, culminating in his arrest for election fraud—a crime that would see him sentenced to thirty years behind bars.

While incarcerated, Lucian refused to be broken by his circumstances. Instead, he used his time in prison to hone his intellect and sharpen his skills, studying law and business through correspondence courses and devouring books on economics and strategy. It was during these long years of confinement that the seeds of his ambition began to take root, as he plotted his return to power and prominence.

Upon his release at the age of fifty, Lucian emerged from prison a changed man—determined to reclaim his rightful place in society and rewrite his own destiny. Armed with a newfound sense of purpose and a wealth of knowledge acquired during his incarceration, he set his sights on a new frontier: the world of business.

With nothing but his wits and a burning desire to succeed, Lucian founded the Venus Conglomerate—a bold venture that defied all expectations and shattered the conventions of corporate hierarchy. Despite facing skepticism and scorn from those who doubted his ability to rebuild his life, he pressed forward with unwavering determination, leveraging his political savvy and street smarts to navigate the treacherous waters of the business world.

As the Venus Conglomerate rose to prominence under his leadership, Lucian's past was all but forgotten, overshadowed by the dazzling success of his entrepreneurial endeavors. To the public, he was hailed as a self-made visionary—a beacon of hope for those who dared to dream of a better future.
