Captain's Recording:

After an agonizing wait, the terminal finally flickers to life, its screen illuminating with a dim glow. Gradually, a recording begins to load, accompanied by the slow progression of a small loading bar. As the bar inches forward, the spectral visage of the ship's captain materialized, her haunted face coming into focus:

*"I am Captain Elena Navarro, Captain of Colony Ship SPX-C-021. Time is a luxury I no longer possess. The bridge has descended into chaos, a cacophony of blaring alarms and cascading system failures. Our once-steadfast navigation systems have betrayed us, plunging us into disarray. The destination we hurtle toward, the jump gate, has transformed into a looming specter of doom.*

*Our mission was noble: to pave the way for humanity's future on Mars, to script a new saga in our history. But now, that aspiration crumbles like fragile glass. Desperately, I fight to wrest control from the clutches of impending disaster, a frantic attempt to wrench us from this catastrophic path. Regrettably, time has slipped through my grasp. The jump gate now stands unwaveringly ahead, a brutal testament to the tragic miscalculations that bind us to this fate. The vortex beckons, its tumultuous dance and blinding luminance a harbinger of our swift undoing.*

*For those who unearth this testament, bear witness to our chronicle, to the fervent battle we waged against the encroaching abyss. May our ordeal stand as a somber lesson, a cautionary parable echoing through generations yet to unfurl. Farewell."*

Gate-Crash

The holographic screen now loads up the last sensor data, revealing the haunting fate of SPX-C-021. The ship is depicted hurtling towards the jump gate, the blaring alarms visible from the bridge. Then, in an instant, the ship collides with the looming gate, shattering it into hundreds, if not thousands, of pieces. The vessel itself breaks apart, and a deafening silence follows as the debris cascades down towards the Martian surface. But just when all seems still, the jump gate's residual energy inexplicably surges to life, propelling the shattered remnants of the ship into an unknown and perilous trajectory.
