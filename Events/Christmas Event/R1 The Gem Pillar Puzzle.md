**The Gem Pillar Puzzle**

*As the players enter the room, they see five pillars arranged in a circular pattern, each adorned with different colored gems: red, green, blue, yellow, and white. In the center of the room is a pedestal with an empty slot in the shape of a star. A mysterious voice intones:*

*"Solve the puzzle, align the gems with glee,*
*All shall advance, but one shall hold the key.*
*A map to the maze, a reward for the swift,*
*Choose wisely, for dangers in shadows drift."*


The riddle on the pedestal is accompanied by an ominous poem etched into the floor:

*"Solve the puzzle, align the gems with glee,*
*All shall advance, but one shall hold the key.*
*A map to the maze, a reward for the swift,*
*Choose wisely, for dangers in shadows drift."*

The symbols on each pillar indicate the order, but now there's an added layer of danger. As the players arrange the pillars correctly, the magical barrier allows only the one who successfully aligns the gems to proceed to the next room, where the maze awaits.

For instance, if the symbols on the pillars are as follows:

Red (Flame)
Green (Leaf)
Blue (Wave)
Yellow (Sun)
White (Snowflake)
The correct order would be: Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, White.


*The riddle on the pedestal guides the players, and the symbols on each pillar indicate the correct order. As the players work together to solve the puzzle, the magical barrier lifts, allowing all to advance. However, the first player to complete the puzzle receives a bonus â€“ a magically enchanted map revealing the layout of the maze that awaits them.*

*The map might include key features of the maze, such as dead ends, traps, or hints about the correct path. This additional information gives the leading player a strategic advantage in navigating the maze.*

*After solving the puzzle, the group proceeds to the next room, where the maze unfolds. The players must now navigate the maze, facing challenges and making decisions based on the information provided by the map. The first player to successfully reach the end of the maze with the Christmas star in hand still wins the challenge.*
