**Room IV: Battle the Guardians**

*As the players traverse the frozen floor, they enter a grand circular chamber. The air is frigid, and a spectral glow emanates from the icy walls. In the center of the room, a group of formidable Ice Guardians materializes. These ethereal beings, composed of animated frost and ice, patrol the circular arena.*

**The Challenge:**

1. **Guardian Patrollers:** The Ice Guardians move in a predictable circular pattern around the room. Stepping into their path triggers their attention, and they will aggressively pursue any intruders.

2. **Jump to the Next Room:** The exit to the next room is located at the center of the circular chamber. To reach it, the players must navigate through the Guardian's patrol path and jump into the opening at the right moment.

3. **Initial Lack of Weapons:** At first, there are no weapons available in the room. Players are encouraged to avoid direct confrontation and focus on timing their movements to avoid the Guardians.

**Weapons and the Possessor of the Map:**

1. **Scattered Ice Weapons:** Upon closer inspection, players may notice weapons encased in ice scattered throughout the room. These ice weapons can be used to fend off the Guardians, providing a means of defense.

2. **Map-Bearer's Advantage:** The possessor of the map holds information about the locations of these ice weapons. The map displays where the weapons are hidden, adding an element of strategy to the players' approach.

**Descriptions of the Guardian Battle:**

1. **Coordinated Movement:** The players must work together to time their movements, avoiding the Guardian's patrol paths and finding opportunities to jump into the opening at the center.

2. **Strategic Use of Weapons:** When the players decide to fight, they can use the ice weapons to temporarily incapacitate the Guardians. However, the weapons are fragile and may break after a few uses.

3. **Dynamic Challenge:** The Guardians increase in speed and aggression over time, intensifying the challenge. Players need to adapt their strategy as the battle unfolds.

*The room emphasizes the importance of teamwork, as players coordinate their movements to outsmart the Guardians. The possessor of the map plays a crucial role in locating weapons that can turn the tide of the battle. Once the players successfully navigate the Guardian's domain and defeat or evade them, they can proceed to the next room, Christmas star still glittering in the distance.*
