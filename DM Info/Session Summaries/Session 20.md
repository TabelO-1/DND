# Session 20

The Party got IDs from the Halfling Guild.

Then they learned to access an elevator ID from the Priestess Elara, she wants a Jump Gate Conduit.

The party went to the Miners. They asked for an increased cut in profits from the Conglomerate.

Party went to the Conglomerate Mining Office and convinced a random guy (who was that guy?) to give them a fake contract to increase their profits.

Gave it to the Miners, they accepted it, gave over the part.

Gave the part to the Church, they gave an Elevator ID.

Used Guild IDs to get past Lower Checkpoint.

Arrived at Upper Checkpoint. Stopped.
