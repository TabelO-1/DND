You awoke a hundred and fifty years after you were supposed to of joined your fellow colonists on Mars on your ship which lays broken in the rings of Saturn.
Afterwards you were quickly captured by a pirate group that jailed you and left the one of the other survivors to die in his cell.
The party then easily broke out and killed all the pirates then escaped...did that feel too easy?

After the escape you flew through a strange object that warped space-time and lead you to an orbital station. The authorities forcefully turned you away but an independent actor named Jayli Marrel, who allowed you to land at her landing platform on the lower decks.

Your party then explored around, finding cat food, a black market, and that Carl(Tyler) was arrested for an impressive list of crimes. Those charges are:

Owning a firearm without a permit.
Unjustified use of lethal force
Attempting to Bribe an Officer
Bringing in illegal substances
Landing without authorization.
Flying a stolen shuttle.
Disturbing the Peace
Firing an firearm

And if that wasn't bad enough your shuttle was impounded and a warrant came out for your arrest.

Deciding that Carl(Tyler) needed to be rescued you explored and found the Halfling Guild who wanted you to save one of their members from the black marketeers.

After causing a shootout between the SWAT and the Marketeers you escaped the choas with Slyva, a younger halfing that works for the guild. Afterwards you met Lucan in a Brothel whom told you about Carl's imprisonment and agreed to further help you if you saved an orphanage from destruction. Sylva also went with you on this task.

After yet another shootout with the Vitral Gangsters, whom dominate the lower slums and are characterized by an red cloth on their arm that hosts a blazing gold sun. They died, and then the party spilt, with most of the party running after being spotted, with Illeva and Boi staying in the orphanage.

The headmistress thanked you for saving her orphanage and offered lodging when you need it. She then stated she offered a favor for later.
