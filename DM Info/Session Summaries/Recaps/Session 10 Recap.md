After being recruited to Colony Mars by SpaceX your ship crashed into it's jumpgate. This universe's fastest travel method, however it's not quite lightspeed.
You awoke in the ship and were promptly captured by pirates known as the Marauders. After easily escaping from them you massacred the entire station.
Currently you are attempting to open the shuttle bay doors, which requires a keycard.
