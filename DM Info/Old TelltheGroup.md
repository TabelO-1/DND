Entering:
They will be somewhat on guard when the group enters and be asking pointed questions about who they are, their intentions, and wether they work for the Venus Conglomerate.

When they first enter, if they enter without knocking, Colt will exclaim how the Venus Conglomerate has found them and Tristan will tell him to be silent.

If they knock: there will be a shuffling inside along with a few words exclaimed. Colt will hide against the wall while Tristan answers the door with an AK-47.

Room description
The room is a simple table in the center with four chairs. 

**If they just walked in:** an AK-47 will be lying next to Tristan.


Conversation:

They will ask who they are, their intentions, and wether they work for the Venus Conglomerate.

When they get to that they were sent by the Halfling Guild they will calm somewhat and ask about what they can do to help.

They will claim that they can get Carl out of the Jail, but they might not like the idea. It involves getting one or more of them arrested and breaking them out from the inside.

Setup: 

Tristan will call the cops on the party member(s) and get them arrested for weapon trafficking. He'll give them the AK-47 for it.

The member(s) may resist or may not but not so much to get themselves killed.

Location: Right next to the Upper Checkpoint in the refining district.


The Refining District:
A warm and bright place where raw resources and gases are refined for the station's countinued operation and commerce.

Brian:
You ran away with everyone else before getting seperated from the others after running into an alley way, you ended up behind a hospital where you found a decent enough place to sleep.
