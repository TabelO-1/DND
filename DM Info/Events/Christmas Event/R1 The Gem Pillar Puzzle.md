**The Gem Pillar Puzzle**

As the players enter the room, they are greeted by a sight of five towering pillars arranged in a circular pattern. Each pillar is adorned with vibrant gems of different colors: red, green, blue, yellow, and white. In the center of the room lies a pedestal with an empty slot in the shape of a star.

The Enchanting Riddle:

"In the realm of colors, magic abounds,
Arrange the gems where harmony is found.
Let the enchantment guide your quest,
To reveal the star, you must be at your best.
Yet, heed this truth, and listen clear,
The star awaits but one pioneer."

The players must now decipher the enchanting riddle and understand that the arrangement of the gems is crucial to revealing the path forward.

Enchanted Gem Patterns:

Red Pillar (Flame): The red gem has a flame pattern that suggests it should be placed first.

Green Pillar (Leaf): The green gem, adorned with a leaf pattern, follows the flame, signifying the cycle of growth.

Blue Pillar (Wave): The blue gem, shaped like a wave, comes next, symbolizing the flow of water.

Yellow Pillar (Sun): The yellow gem, radiating like the sun, takes its place in the sequence.

White Pillar (Snowflake): Lastly, the white gem, with a delicate snowflake pattern, completes the arrangement.

Clue: Celestial Mural

On the wall behind the pillars, there is a celestial mural depicting a harmonious sequence of celestial events:

A comet blazing with a red flame.
Leaves budding on a tree beneath a serene blue sky.
Waves crashing on a sunlit shore.
A radiant sun shining over a golden landscape.
A serene snowfall covering a peaceful winter scene.
Challenge:

Observation of the Celestial Mural: The players need to carefully observe the celestial mural to discern the sequence of events.

Connection to Gem Patterns: The celestial events depicted in the mural correspond to the enchanted gem patterns on the pillars.
