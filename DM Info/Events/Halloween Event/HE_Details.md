The Granddaughter shares information about the pendant, revealing that it was originally a family heirloom and had been stolen from her.

A character who had a close relationship with the victim, which includes the murderer, may become a suspect due to their knowledge of the pendant's significance and their potential motive to reclaim it.

As the tension escalates, the murderer suddenly takes an NPC hostage or threatens the lives of others in the room, showing their willingness to kill to keep their secret. The players face a moral dilemma as they must decide whether to negotiate with the murderer, attempt a rescue, or find another solution to prevent further harm.
