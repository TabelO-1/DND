# Part 0: Escape Marauder Station

 In the year 2150, the SpaceX Mars Colonization Project reached fruition. Many Colony ships were sent with people onboard them. According to history, Colony Ship SPX-C-021 had a jump gate miscalculation and instead rammed into the jump gate, destroying the gate and the ship.

 Now the players were colonists, and will wake up from their cryo-stasis cells to the intruder alarm. They will have time to realize they are drifting through space with just a small fraction of the ship. After a brief fight, they will be subdued. Over the next few months they will remain Prisoners. Gavin, another colonist taken with will be killed during that remainder.

 The station will come under attack and will be disabled. Causing it to lose power and the characters' cell door to unlock. They will fight to the hanger and come toe to toe with the attacking force, who reveal themselves as AstroCorp. AstroCorp let's them come onto their shuttle and they make their escape.

 AstroCorp will ask some questions and run a DNA test(either voluntary or not). They will realize they were an early colonist, somehow, and since only the best were taken(or so history says). They will attempt to recruit them for a mission: Kuiper Belt Mining Rights




The players find themselves the prisoners of the Marauders and have been for months when the pirate base becomes under attack by an unknown force. During which they would be captured/protected by the attacking force, known as AstroCorp.
Once they escaped with AstroCorp they reveal their intentions: AstroCorp has heard of this group's reputation and requires their services with a problem of theirs, if the players got disagreeable during this, they would starkly remind them of who they owe their freedom to, and that they could put them right back in Jail
If the players refuse then they will be sent back to prison(We will get to that path later). Their offer is to provide protection and money to the group if they helped them secure their position in the Kuiper Belt.
