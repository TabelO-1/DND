# Part 0: Escape Marauder Station






The players find themselves the prisoners of the Marauders and have been for months when the pirate base becomes under attack by an unknown force. During which they would be captured/protected by the attacking force, known as AstroCorp.
Once they escaped with AstroCorp they reveal their intentions: AstroCorp has heard of this group's reputation and requires their services with a problem of theirs, if the players got disagreeable during this, they would starkly remind them of who they owe their freedom to, and that they could put them right back in Jail
If the players refuse then they will be sent back to prison(We will get to that path later). Their offer is to provide protection and money to the group if they helped them secure their position in the Kuiper Belt.
