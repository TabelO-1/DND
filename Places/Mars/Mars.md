 * Mars, Earth's first attempt at colonization of another celestial body, ended horribly after SpaceX's SPX-C-021 made a miscalcuation that caused the jump gate there to be destroyed instantly. Since SPX-C-021 wasn't found among the wreckage, it's fate is unknown. The colony suffered horribly in the 5 years it took for SpaceX to send another ship to construct a new jump gate.
