## Mercury II Minor Orbital Colony
 * Population: 1.5k

 * After their sucess at Venus, the Venus Conglomerate branched out to Mercury with the Mecury I Major Orbital Colony, and nearly 25,000 people lived on it until a terrible solar flair engulfed the entire station. The MIIOC was recently erected there with a population of 1.5k as not many wish to risk being burnt to a crisp by the sun.
