In the shuttle: As you travel through space thinking back on your ordeal you start to feel stronger somehow. [Everyone_levels_up_to_lv2]

After a few hours of travel you came out of a jumpgate where upon turning the ship you saw a massive space station. [Show Image]. The station is swarming with ships. You can see what you think could be several mining ships, trade and cargo ships. Additionally you spot several armed ships patrolling around the area. Behind the station is a planet towering behind it making this station seem small. This is obviously the planet Venus as no other planet in the solar system has such a dominant orange-yellow surface. As you take in this scene a red button on your dashboard starts glowing.

[When_they_press_it]: A female voice iterates: "This is Venus I Orbital Command, please transmit your clearance code."
[If_they_find_the_code/if_they_bluff_or_fake]: After a few minutes the female voice iterates back: "You are not cleared to land, please depart station space."
[If_they_do_nothing]: The female voice iterates again: "This is Venus I Orbital Command, please transmit your clearance code"

Results: If they attempt to land anyways fighters will come along their side and contact them: "If you countinue your flight path you will be destroyed."
After this the part will receive another transmission from a different female voice: "Hey uh...if your looking for somewhere to land you could come to my landing pad on the lower levels. It's not the greatest but it will get those bullies off your back."
