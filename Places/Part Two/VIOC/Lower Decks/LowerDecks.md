The players ultimately need to rise upwards in the station, they can get the support of one or more factions. Upon arrival to the lower decks they will be presented by an NPC:
Jayli Marrel, who will want payment for landing on his landing bay, a small fee of 20 Credits. Can be disauded from collection easily. He will be able to answer questions the players have. His opinions are:
VC - Authorative
Astro - Shady
Marauders - Bad Business
Miners - Sad Organization likely to be crushed.
The CAB - A strange chruch worshipping even stranger deities.
Vitral Gangsters - A plight on the lower decks and he wishes they would move out.
Halfling Guild - Good people with good prices.

Docks - His livelihood and where most others make theirs, however has alot of criminal activity so there are many guards.
Market - Where goods are sold and many factions are based.
Upper Slums - Where the more richer poor live.
Lower Slums - Where the poorer poor live and where the Vitral Gangsters are based.

No matter which route the players take they will come onto the following encounter:

4 cloaked figures running and being chased into a corner by VC guards. The Figures include 2 AstroCorp operatives, 1 Miner Leader, and a Halfling Guild Representative who were caught attempting to bypass the checkpoint with sensitive information on the VC. This information includes proof on how the VC is imprisioning and executing Miner leaders and representatives. 7 Guards:
Tralick Venel - VC Checkpoint Head
6 Guards - 2 Stun Batons, 2 Tasers, 2 Glock-27s. LV2D1.
4 Cloaked Figures:
Balden Jei - Miner Leader
Slyva - Halfing Guild Representative
AstroCorp Operatives - 2 Glock 27s
The players will have a choice in who to help or to just ignore the chase into of itself

IF they help the guards or choose not to help the "Good Guys" will be arrested or killed and thrown in jail, be questioned and tortured. If they choose to help the guards the leader will be thankful and offer them a deal: complete some work for them and he will reward them well. If they complete either of these the "Good Guys" won't know a thing about their involvement.
If they help the "Good Guys" they will become enemies of the VC(Unless they kill everyone quickly) and it will take some action to escape their criminal activity. The "Good Guys" will be grateful and offer immediate shelter and then subsequently ask for help with their cause.
