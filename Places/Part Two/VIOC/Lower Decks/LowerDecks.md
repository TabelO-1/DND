VC - Authorative
Astro - Shady
Marauders - Bad Business
Miners - Sad Organization likely to be crushed.
The CAB - A strange chruch worshipping even stranger deities.
Vitral Gangsters - A plight on the lower decks and he wishes they would move out.
Halfling Guild - Good people with good prices.

Docks - His livelihood and where most others make theirs, however has alot of criminal activity so there are many guards.
Market - Where goods are sold and many factions are based.
