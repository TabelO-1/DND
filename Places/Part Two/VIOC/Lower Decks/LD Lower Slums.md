A desperate place near the prison where hopelessness and despair is felt and known.

This place is the home to the Vitral Gangsters, and their HQ at the Vitral Pub. The Gangsters make their presence known and do not take anything towards their authority.

The Quiet Garden Orphanage: a quaint and falling apart orphanage with staff trying their very best with Orphans that are actually wholesome. Small problem, the Vitral Gangsters keep picking on them.
