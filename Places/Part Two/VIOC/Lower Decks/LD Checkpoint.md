The Central Spire in the lower half of the station has a elevator that goes up and down the entire bottom half's area. Only Conglomerate Employees and Authorizied Persons may travel using the elavator. To access it the players will need to create a fake id card, steal one, or find an organziation that would give them a real one. These ids will get them past checkpoints, however each ID only allows different access points and they will need different access cards to reach the high class area.

The Lower Decks Checkpoint has high security with 5 different booths to check identities and each booth has 3 guards with 3 entrances into the checkpoint with 4 guards at each entrance.
Once you enter the area, leaving is difficult. Anyone attempting to leave after entering will be questioned.

Possible entrances:
Through the checkpoint with a fake ID will require someone to make it. The guard gets to roll a investigation check with advantage on the fake id. If they roll a 16 or above they will detect the ids are fake.

On Success:
The players will pass through the checkpoint

On Failure:
The guards will confront the players about this.
If they choose to threaten: 17 or above
If they choose to convince: 15 or above
If they choose to bribe:
400-600+ will suceed without a check.
Under 400 requires 12+
200-400 requires 15+
Under 200 Fails no matter what.

On Double Failure the guards will attempt to arrest the players. If they go quietly then they will be sent to prison, if they fight the guards will overwhelm them.

On a stolen id the guards will roll an investigation check, if they roll a 16 or above they will detect the stolen id. Same options as with a fake id.

The Characters can attempt to bribe the guards, same rules outlined, same failure rules.

On a real id issued by a corporation will pass the checkpoint guareenteed.

The characters may attempt to stealth past the checkpoint using vents to sneak past and then use the elavator by either hacking or using a ID. The vents will not be easily found, they can only be passed with bribing a guard at a different point in the story. This is a guareenteed sucess.
