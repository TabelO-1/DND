The Station Has Four Zones which are broken down into different subsections, Each Zone has a checkpoint inbetween them. They are from top to bottom.
Control Spire: This is where the station is controlled by the Conglomerate and managed. Only the higher-ups and super-rich people can access this area. No additional subsections.
Trade Center and High-Class Living: This is where the station's mining is bought and sold, along with where the high-class individuals live. It is also where the station's orbital thrusters (what it uses to stay afloat) are located: It can be broken down into the following three subsections:
  1. Center Spire: A spire that has the main elevator that runs through the entire station.
  2. East Side: The East Half of the Station is mainly dedicated to the homes of the Rich.
  3, West Side: The west side is dedicated to business and has its own docks.
Station Center: The Center of the station and the least populated, it's divided into three subsections:
  1. Top Section: Contains the Main Gravity Generator and its workers.
  2. Middle Section: Contains the Main Power Reactor and its workers.
  3. Bottom Section: Contains the station's main cargo hold, holding all of the Station's supplies. High Security Here.
Lower Decks: The lower part of the station can be broken into three subsections:
  1. Slums: Very poor people and many gangs reside here.
  2. Lower Docks: Docks for lower-class mining operations and some illegal activity, with little to no security.
  3. Bottom of the Spire: Contains the very bottom of the spire, mostly abandoned with some secrets.

The Central Spire in the lower half of the station has a elevator that goes up and down the entire bottom half's area. Only Conglomerate Employees and Authorizied Persons may travel using the elavator. To access it the players will need to create a fake id card, steal one, or find an organziation that would give them a real one. These ids will get them past checkpoints, however each ID only allows different access points and they will need different access cards to reach the high class area.
