 * Population: 1.5k
 * Explorable Areas: Tbd
 * After their sucess at Venus, the Venus Conglomerate branched out to Mercury with the Mecury I Major Orbital Colony, and nearly 25,000 people lived on it until a terrible solar flair engulfed the entire station. The MIIOC was recently erected there with a population of 1.5k as not many wish to risk being burnt to a crisp by the sun.
## Venus
 * Earth's Closest Next Door Neighbor, this planet is home to the *Venus I Major Orbital Colony*. Spread out across the planet are protection zones ultizing expiremental shield technology to provide mining zones for the safe aquisiton of minerals and exotic gasses.

## Earth
 * Civilized Population: 300k

 * Explorable Areas: North Europe PZ, West Europe PZ, North America East PZ, North America West PZ, North America Central PZ, South America PZ, Japan PZ, Asia PZ, Egypt PZ.
 * After Earth's Environmental Crisis turned irreversiable, the planet became an unihabitable wasteland. The rich left for the Earth Orbital Staion amongst other places leaving a majority of the population to die. Those who survived because savages and a large amount of them remain to this day. Due to breakthroughs on expiremental shield technology, the Earth Government has opened several PZ(Protection Zones) to allow nature to come back to the planet. These Zones are often threatened by the savages roaming the hills.
## Earth Orbital Station
 * Population: 75k
 * Factions: Earth Government, AstroCorp, Miners
 * Explorable Areas: tbd
